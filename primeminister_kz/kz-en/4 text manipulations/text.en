      This was announced by Deputy Prime Minister Imangali Tasmagambetov during the plenary session "The state and prospects of development of civil society" in the framework of the VII of the Civil Forum.
      "Another area which I would like to draw your attention to is the socialization of compatriots returning to Kazakhstan. Here, the state and NGOs also have a large untapped potential.11,000 families returned home this year, which is 6 times more than in 2015. Our fellow citizens need help in preparation of documents, training, social adaptation. Just at this point the role of NGOs is almost indispensable, because you can not embed the administrative mechanisms of repatriates into the new society for them. This can only be done by gradually involving them in the design of the public," Deputy Prime Minister said.
      He also singled out the problem of the development of civil society institutions in the regions.
      "It is no secret that the majority of well-known leaders of NGOs, as are non-governmental organizations are basically two centers - Astana and Almaty.

      The reserve fund, which was created for all of the regional mayor's offices of the republic,currently has 20 billion tenge in case of danger of flooding, said Vice-Minister of Internal Affairs Yuriy Ilyin at a press conference after the Government session.

      Overall, according to Deputy Minister, the Office carried out extensive work to prevent flooding during flood period.
      There are about 60 of hydraulic structures under special control of Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kazakhstan, which may pose a threat in case of overflow.
      "They are in working condition for today and controlled by a local executive bodies and departments of the Ministry of Agriculture," Yu.Ilin said.
      Vice-Minister noted that there are 27 emergency and orphan hydraulic structures in Kazakhstan. They are under the control of Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Committee of Water Resources.
      According to Vice Minister, much work is being done with the neighboring countries in the event of flood water passes from the border area. In addition, these excesses have occurred in past year. For example, a large water gaps observed in Black Irtysh from China in East Kazakhstan region in 2016.
      "We carry out work not only with the Ministry of Agriculture in Kazakhstan, but also cooperate with our colleagues from Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, China and Russia," Deputy Minister said.
      In this regard, the threat can be expected on the part of Russia. Since, according to Russian experts, snow reserves in Urals and Lower Urals can trigger large flow of water in West Kazakhstan region.
      Occupancy of water is 70 to 87% in other regions.
      Yu.Ilin also noted that problematic issue with lake Maybalyk was raised in Astana; the overflow may could threaten the airport. In order to the lake is not filled, the Office decided not to open the relief sluice No.2.

      In 2018, 38,250 Kazakhstani families were provided with housing, while every fourth loan was issued within the framework of the State Housing Program Nurly Zher. This was announced today at a press conference in the Government by the Chairman of the JSC Housing Construction Savings Bank of Kazakhstan Lyazzat Ibragimova.

      “For three years under the Nurly Zher program we have issued and provided housing for the sum of almost 100 billion tenge. The most record was the year 2018 — our depositors and the waiting list received 8,659 apartments. Now we have more than 1.2 million open deposits in our portfolio, from which more than 150 thousand depositors are waiting for local executive bodies. This housing was provided for 64 billion tenge, about 10% of investors saved up on this value completely inside the bank and were able to make a full redemption,” Ibragimova informed.
      As she noted, the Nurly Zher program provides the most favorable conditions in the country. Firstly, one must have the citizenship of the Republic of Kazakhstan or the status of oralman, and secondly, during the last five years the depositor should not have had housing.
      “The bank provides only those who have no housing. These people come to us from akimats, pass the assessment of solvency and receive a loan for the conditions of 20% down payment, with a rate of 5% for this loan. Under the terms of the program, the cost of 1 m² of rental housing is fixed and amounts to 180,000 tenge in Astana, Almaty, Atyrau and Aktau. In other regions, the price does not exceed 140,000 tenge,” she said.
      In 2019, the bank plans to credit its depositors under the Nurly Zher program for 59.7 billion tenge. Housing under the State Program for the bank clients will be implemented in all regions of the country. In 2019, according to regional akimats, it is planned to commission another 14,220 apartments.
      In total, under this state program (since the end of 2016), 13,197 Kazakhstanis could celebrate a housewarming. Loans for the redemption of square meters were issued in the amount of 98.2 billion tenge. Of these, 69% of the funds were allocated from the republican budget, another 31% were own funds of the bank. The greatest demand is noted for two-bedroom apartments, more than 60% of the realized housing are apartments with two rooms.
      “In his Address, 'Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Incomes and Quality of Life,' the Head of State highlighted the success of the Nurly Zher program, which provided a powerful impetus to housing construction and helped thousands of Kazakhstanis to find their homes. With its help, those who stand in line for housing in local akimats, those who work in the public sector and whose income does not allow to buy housing on market terms can buy an apartment at preferential prices,” Ibragimova said.
      It is worth noting that, in general, the Nurly Zher program accounts for 50% of the housing sold in the primary market through the Housing Construction Savings Bank. In total, in 2018, the bank has helped 38,295 Kazakhstani families to purchase their housing. Now 1.3 million Kazakhstanis trust their savings in the bank. On their accounts, they have already collected 624.2 billion tenge. To save them for future housing helps not only the bank, but also the state. All depositors of the bank receive a state bonus of 20%. It is charged on an amount not exceeding 200 MCI (505,000 tenge in 2019). According to the 2018 results, the depositors of the state will receive a state bonus in the first half of February 2019.
      Recall that the JSC Housing Construction Savings Bank of Kazakhstan is the only bank in the country that implements the system of housing construction savings. The Bank is a member of the European Federation of Building Savings Banks and the International Housing Finance Union. The sole shareholder of the bank is Baiterek National Management Holding JSC.

      Deputy Prime Minister of Kazakhstan - Minister of Agriculture of Kazakhstan Askar Myrzakhmetov met with agricultural producers of the southern regions of Kazakhstan in Taraz today; where the program under development has been already discussed.

      Following the approval by the Head of State the concept of agribusiness development program for 2017-2021, it has been accepted by the Government of Kazakhstan. The program was discussed in the Parliament and the Government of Kazakhstan.
      Implementation of the new role of agribusiness will balance the country's sustainable development, increase productivity and improve living standards of the general population. The achievement of these goals is possible through a large-scale cooperation.
      KazAgro Holding will provide cooperatives with technological equipment. Support will also be provided through subsidies for cooperatives to provide costs for personal subsidiary plots of veterinary, agrochemical, financial, marketing and other services.
      Development of agricultural cooperation will provide additional load processing plants by 30%, and decline the trade margin of 15-20% by reducing intermediary links.
      The program aims to involve more than 500 thousand smallholdings and small-scale peasants in commodity production and the creation of more than 1200 agricultural cooperation by 2021.
      Cooperatives will provide its members with veterinary services, agrochemicals, forage, slaughtering, milk collection, product storage and distribution logistics. For example, the villagers need hay for their cattle. The cost is 7-8 thousand tenge per ton; it is sold for 20 thousand- in summer, 30 thousand tenge in autumn, 40-50 thousand tenge - in winter. The cooperative, with the support of state, taking tractor, mower, trailer for rent, can provide the villagers with hay at cost, as well as co-operatives, in a word, we must address all the issues that today are hindering the development of production factors for smallholders and small-scale farms, will supply the villagers with mixed fodders, through its small preparation center.
      Another possibility of cooperation is that the cooperatives can become the rural credit institution.

      Today, on behalf of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture A. Myrzakhmetov arrived to Akmola and Pavlodar regions on a working trip.

      Today, in fulfillment of the instruction of the Head of State, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture A. Myrzakhmetov paid a regular working visit to one of the main grain-growing regions of the Republic – North Kazakhstan region. As part of the working trip, he got acquainted with the progress of the sowing campaign and discussed the issues of development of agricultural machinery.

      The Deputy Prime Minister held a meeting on the issues of domestic agricultural machinery development. The meeting was attended by directors of local factories, representatives of agricultural machinery companies, as well as agricultural producers.
      One of the tasks of the new AIC Development State program is the supply of agricultural producers with modern technique and equipment, as well as the development of agricultural machinery in the Republic.
      To implement these tasks, a working group was created, which included representatives of the state and quasi-public sector, representatives of enterprises which produce agricultural technique and equipment. Based on the results of the working group meetings, as well as the analysis of the reasons delaying the renewal of the machine and tractor fleet and reasons for low levels of production, the Ministry of Agriculture developed the Agricultural Machinery Development Roadmap.
      The activities indicated in the Roadmap will allow raising the level of production of existing capacities, opening up new types of production, increasing the range of products, and ultimately enabling farmers to provide qualitative and inexpensive domestic production equipment that are not inferior in their characteristics to world analogues.
      It should be noted that from this year the approaches to subsidizing machinery and equipment oriented to domestic production have been changed.
      If earlier one combine harvester of foreign production cost more than 30 million tenge of compensation, now 3 combine harvesters will be subsidized for these funds.
      At the same time, foreign equipment will also be subsidized, but due to its high cost, reimbursement will be at the level of 5-7%, while the subsidy for the acquisition of domestic equipment will be at 25%.
      "Approaches to providing “KazAgroFinance” JSC with leasing techniques have been revised, primarily by reorienting to domestic producer. These measures already allow increasing the volume of purchased equipment by 50-70%, which will subsequently increase the renewal rate by 1.5-2 times,” – the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
      The meeting discussed the implementation of the Roadmap, discussed the prospects for developing agricultural machinery production, in particular taking into account the capacity of the production facilities of North Kazakhstan region, and the opportunities for cooperation between enterprises from different regions on producing agricultural machinery, equipment, spare parts and components.
      In addition, the regional Akimat hosted a group conference with representatives of 3 regions on conducting spring field work.
      In the current year, effective diversification of crop areas began within the framework of the State Program.
      To this end, memoranda between the Ministry and the Akimats have been developed and signed, which provide the expansion of the areas of oilseeds and fodder crops, cereals and grain crops, and sugar beet for a total area of about 900 thousand hectares already this year.
      During the meeting, A. Myrzakhmetov emphasized that it is important to increase the efficiency of each hectare of arable land to produce high-yield crops that have the export potential.
      In general, while familiarizing with preparations for spring sowing, the Minister focused on the fact that for the first time, the final rate for loans for spring field work was reduced to 6% per annum for final borrowers, while last year it was 9%. This is achieved by reducing the number of links in the chain of credit. In addition, as a whole, the required package of documents has been reduced for credit products.
      The subsidies for original and elite seeds have been renewed this year. It should be said that the amount of budget funds allocated to support seed production this year exceeds the level of last year by more than 3 times. The minimum standards have been abolished, this will allow to interest farmers in receiving subsidies, since under the old scheme only a small amount of seeds was subsidized.
      The mechanism of subsidizing fertilizers has been changed. If earlier the subsidy rate was set in percentage terms, this year they are provided in absolute figures. This allowed farmers to choose fertilizers for quality and price regardless of the country of origin and expand the range of used fertilizers. This year, there are 156 types of subsidized fertilizers, in 2016 there were 85. Today 200 thousand tonnes have already been purchased.
      Currently, in the main grain-bearing regions of the northern region (Akmola, Kostanay, North Kazakhstan), the sowing of agricultural crops is in full swing. As of May 23 this year, in these regions spring cereal crops were sown on an area of about 5.0 million hectares, which is 44% of the plan. Oilseeds are sown on 771 thousand hectares (60.4%), vegetable crops - on 8.9 thousand hectares (73.3%), potatoes are planted on 48.8 thousand hectares (88.1%). In the North Kazakhstan region, sugar beet is sown on an area of 400 hectares or 35% of the plan.
      The rates of sowing are mostly good - the sown areas of grain crops exceed the level of last year by 124 thousand hectares or 2.6%, oil crops - by 222 thousand hectares (40.5%), potatoes - 1 thousand hectares (2%), vegetables - 0.5 thousand hectares (6%).
      The Deputy Prime Minister also paid attention to problematic agroholdings. Currently, on the instructions of the Head of State, a working group has been created, which includes representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture, Akimats of Akmola, Kostanay and North Kazakhstan regions, NCE Atameken, Association of Financiers of Kazakhstan, JSC “NMH “KazAgro”, and second-tier banks.
      Boards of creditors were created for every problematic agroholdings, which take collegial measures of recovery for each enterprise that is part of agroholdings.
      It should be recalled that business entities of North Kazakhstan region were also visited as part of the working trip.

      At the press conference at the Government’s press center, the Minister of Finance Alikhan Smailov spoke about the progress of the tax amnesty for small and medium-sized businesses.

      As part of the tax amnesty for SMEs, penalties and fines subject to payment of arrears recorded in personal accounts as of Oct. 1, 2018, will be written off. In general, the tax amnesty covers about 90 thousand SMEs, who have the main tax debt of 210 billion tenge. If you pay these debts, the Ministry of Finance will write off 130 billion tenge of fines and penalties.
      As of today, about 28 thousand taxpayers have already repaid the arrears in excess of 5.9 billion tenge. Accordingly, 1.1 billion tenge of penalties and 0.1 billion tenge of fines are due.
      “We give businesses the opportunity to pay the principal debt, while not paying penalties and fines. For citizens who pay off the main body of the debt, which is available as of Jan. 1, 2019, all accrued interest will be written off. The state receives tax revenues. For example, according to the amnesty for small and medium-sized businesses that have debts Oct. 1, it is about 90 thousand, the state should receive more than 200 billion tenge of additional tax revenues in case all taxpayers pay the main body of debt,” Smailov said.
      In addition, according to the minister, this measure makes the economy healthier in general. That is, if there are no overdue debts, then the company can continue to operate, credit, build relationships with the state, etc.
      “Such events were held in our country earlier: in 2011, 2015, they had a positive effect. According to the last amnesty, about 70% of those enterprises that went through amnesty now work without any debts. Therefore, I consider that it is useful both for business and for the state,” the minister noted.
      According to him, the necessary changes will be made to the Tax Code in order to conduct a tax amnesty for individuals. Today, 1.4 million citizens have tax arrears of 21 billion tenge, including 6.6 billion tenge of penalties.
      Another impetus for the further development of SMEs is the reduction of checks. According to the Ministry of Finance, the number of inspections in 2016 was 77 thousand, in 2017 — 42 thousand, in 2018 — 38 thousand, that is, the number of inspections was reduced by more than 2 times. At the same time, improving the quality of inspections while reducing their number allowed us to ensure the growth rate of collection of assessed sums by 35%. As a result, an additional 45 billion tenge was received by the budget through audits.

The priority is the project to create a special border trade zone on the border of Mangystau region and Balkan velayat. In addition, prospects implementing a joint project to create a remote Earth sensing system in Turkmenistan were considered.
      “The heads of our states — President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev and President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov — have tasked us to bring the mutual trade mark to billion. It is necessary to intensify the work of the joint Intergovernmental Commission on Economic, Scientific, Technical and Cultural Cooperation. There is a need to gradually increase mutual trade, using tools to stimulate mutually beneficial export supplies between the two countries and expand the range of goods supplied,” said Mamin, noting the need to increase trade in such industries as metallurgy, engineering, construction materials, food, chemical products , light industry, pharmaceuticals and others.

      Feb. 8, 2019, First Deputy Prime Minister Askar Mamin took part and spoke at the forum “Digital Labels in the EAEU as the Basis of a Transparent Environment for Business, Government and Consumers.”

      The forum was attended by Board Member, Minister for Trade of the Eurasian Economic Commission Veronika Nikishina, Minister of Industry and Infrastructure Development of Kazakhstan Zhenis Kassymbek, Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Alexey Besrozvannyh, Deputy Minister for Tax and Duties of Belarus Vladimir Mukvich, Deputy Minister of Economy of Kyrgyzstan Dastan Kadyrov.
      First Vice Premier of Kazakhstan noted the importance of developing digital technologies in industrial and excisable products, agriculture, pharmaceuticals and the creation of new opportunities for trade growth in the context of further integration within the EAEU.
      “Thanks to joint efforts to stimulate trade, eliminate barriers, standardize the institutional environment, we created new and expanded the existing growth mechanisms of our economies, which contributed to the high growth rates of the economies of the EAEU countries,” said Mamin.
      Against the background of a tightening monetary conditions and a steady reduction of the space for investment policy, the introduction of a labeling and traceability system for goods in the EAEU space is of particular relevance.
      “Combating the circulation of unlicensed products is a practically untapped mechanism for creating additional space for the development of industries, reducing costs for domestic producers, increasing the base for expanding the state budget revenues and increasing citizens' well-being,” said the First Deputy Prime Minister.
      According to the International Chamber of Commerce, the volume of under-collection of sales taxes, caused by the displacement of legal producers, is almost $90 billion a year, with a disproportionately high share in developing countries.
      “At the same time, the technological equipment of unscrupulous manufacturers and suppliers is being improved, products of inadequate quality cover all price segments during each stage of the creation of added value,” said Mamin.
      It is natural that the widespread implementation of projects in the field of labeling and tracing of goods has been one of the main trends in international and domestic trade over the past 10 years. According to research conducted by the international consulting company Boston Consulting Group, in the next 10 years the list of groups to be labeled will reach 70-80% of all types of goods. Projects operating in the PRC, Brazil, Turkey, the United States and the European Union have demonstrated their success, already allowing for increased tax collection in the affected industries by 20–40%.
      After the launch of labeling projects, countries have significantly reduced the “gray” market, expanded the budget revenues. A bona fide business returns the revenue lost due to counterfeit revenue, increasing sales due to unfair competition leaving the market.
      “Thanks to the common efforts within the framework of cooperation of the EAEU, a successful trend is becoming a reality in our countries,” said Mamin, noting that “the necessary legal basis for implementing this direction has been laid within the framework of the EAEU, there are successful examples of the initiative’s implementation.”
      Running processes will have a positive impact on the economy of Kazakhstan. A 1% reduction in counterfeit volume will lead to the release of space for legal business only in retail sales of up to $100 million.
      “We have one goal — to increase commodity turnover and create a legal market, reducing the shadow economy, leveling the competitive conditions of doing business within the Union,” said Mamin and noted that a joint integrated approach will have a multiplicative effect for the economies of the EAEU countries.

      May 25 this year the First Deputy Prime Minister, Askar Mamin, took part and spoke at the VIII International Mining and Metallurgy Congress in Astana.

      A. Mamin noted the importance of the Forum as an international platform for discussion and resolution of the most important issues in the mining and metallurgical complex, emphasizing that "the Head of State pays special attention to the development of the mining and metallurgical complex for sustainable economic growth."
      Kazakhstan ranks 7th in the world in terms of iron core reserves and 33rd in the world in terms of steel production. In the overall structure of industrial production, the mining and metallurgical complex takes more than 18%.
      For the first time in recent years, there are positive trends in the mining and metallurgical industry of the world caused by the rise in world prices for base metals, the revival of markets and a reduction in costs for most leading mining companies, A. Mamin noted.
      "Following the results of 4 months of 2017, the growth of the economy of Kazakhstan amounted to 3.7%. The volume of industrial production was 107.1%, including in mining - 107.8%, in manufacturing - 106.8%, "the First Deputy Prime Minister said.
      "It is important for us to maintain the positive dynamics of the industry's growth and effectively use our competitive advantages", Mamin emphasized in this regard.
      According to his words, the main technological trend in the mining and metallurgical industry is the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Today, there are positive examples of application of elements of Industry 4.0, which allow using low-cost technological solutions to reduce the cost of production and at times increase the volume of products.
      Taking into account the fact that Kazakhstan is one of the largest producers of iron ore raw materials and steel products, work is under way to become a member of the OECD Steel Committee. Membership in the OECD will allow participating in the development of decisions on the problems of subsidies and state support for metallurgical enterprises and to make efforts to develop fair competition in the steel market, including taking into account the requirements of the WTO.
      Noting the relevance of the discussed topics, A. Mamin wished the forum participants effective work on developing approaches to solving issues of industrial and environmental safety, developing new products in the MMC, introducing innovative technologies.

      Jan. 17 at a press conference in the Government's press center, Chairman of the Board of Housing Construction Savings Bank of Kazakhstan JSC Lyazzat Ibragimova spoke about the implementation of the Askeri Baspana program for military personnel.

      In 2018, after a change in legislation, the bank opened 70 thousand special accounts for military personnel to buy housing. The money in these accounts is inviolable and cannot be arrested because of military debts, for example, in case of non-payment of a loan.
      In July 2018, the Askeri Baspanа program was launched. The bank offered preferential terms to servicemen for buying an apartment: the interest rate is from 6 to 8% per annum, the down payment is from 5 to 20%. Loans will get those applicants who score more points. Points are calculated at the rate for each full month of service. Those who have served longer have more chances.
      According to Ibragimova, askeri.baspana.kz received 13 thousand hits through a specially developed website of the Housing Construction Savings Bank of Kazakhstan JSC. Of these, 5.5 thousand soldiers each received a positive decision on the loan, the documents were signed, at the moment the applicants are looking for apartments.
      In total, 2,250 people have already received affordable loans from the bank and settled in their apartments. Documents of 250 military personnel are pending at the bank.
      “We plan until April 1, 2019 to consider all documents of 5.5 thousand servicemen who received a positive decision on the loan and start the second program,” said Ibragimova.
      Responding to questions from the media, she also spoke about the ongoing work on the provision of services online.
      So, Kazakhstanis can find out about all the facilities being constructed under the Nurly Zher program on the website baspana.kz. On the portal, the applicant can choose the city in which he wants to buy an apartment of available square meters, and see which objects are being built, whether applications are received, choose an apartment he likes, apply for participation in the pool of home buyers.
      “Every year the number of depositors is growing: we already have 1.2 million depositors, although 3 years ago there were 600 thousand. At the same time, the number of people in the bank does not increase. Therefore, over the past 3 years we have focused on the tremendous automation of all business processes,” said Ibragimova.
      First of all, there is an opportunity to call a home consultant and he will open a deposit from his special tablet right at home. Secondly, depositors can replenish a deposit from a card of any bank without fees, regardless of the amount. The third stage of automation is the submission of documents through the electronic portal. Throughout 2018, the collection of applications, the distribution of apartments and other processes were carried out through the portal baspana.kz, which is associated with Internet banking.
      “We are planning to implement a large prequalification project. Many investors are concerned about the question: with a real income of 100-120 thousand tenge per month, how much they could claim. The ‘pre-qualification’ institute will be launched in early 2019 and will give each depositor an opportunity to receive information about how much the loan can be approved at the bank,” explained the speaker.
      The average age of the depositor is 36 years. 150 thousand of children's deposits open from 0 to 18 years. According to Ibragimova, people who once used the bank’s services understand the advantages and begin to save money from the birth of a child. Every third investor is between the ages of 18 and 29 — this is, as the speaker says, a priority group.
      "In the Year of Youth (2019, declared by the Head of State as the Year of Youth) we will handle various initiatives for young families who have several families in order to make programs not only in the primary market, but also in the secondary one, including and extension tools. Because when we consider the various segments of our investors, we see that each segment of the population has its own needs. In the beginning, a person comes — he wants to buy a one-room apartment in order to get a roof over his head. After 3-4 years, he turns to us with a request for an increase (area), because there are children. And this life cycle is very important, we will try to develop programs that at every stage of the family could meet the needs of depositors,” the bank’s chairman concluded.

For the first time in the history of Central Asia, the Astana International Financial Center with a special status and jurisdiction was launched on the basis of Expo 2017. From 2019, the Fund for Direct Investments in the Non-Primary Sector will start working on the best world model, and will co-invest with foreign investors to implement large and breakthrough projects.
      Vice President for Eastern Europe and the CIS of Air Liquide Company Olivier Randet, having received his award, expressed his gratitude to Head of State Nursultan Nazarbayev for his constructive investment attraction policy.
      “On September 1 this year we launched a hydrogen plant at the Pavlodar refinery. It is an honor for us to be at this awards ceremony for foreign investors. We pay tribute to Kazakhstan for the contribution made to the development of human capital and to the successful development of the economy,” said a spokesman for Air Liquide.
      The Director General of Lukoil LLP Andrey Matyukhov, in turn, shared the observations that he had accumulated over his 20 years of work in Kazakhstan.
      “It is very touching and exciting to receive such an award. Today we are implementing a project for the construction of a plant for the production of lubricants with a capacity of 100 thousand tons in the Almaty region. I would like to note that a very favorable investment climate has been created in the country,” said Matyukhov.
      The project developer for the construction of a solar power plant of Solarnet Investment Jan Zonenschein also noted the favorable investment policy pursued in Kazakhstan.
      “Building a company here in Kazakhstan in a very short time was a very big challenge for us, a great challenge. We started construction in July this year, and now in December we are ready to launch. We are pleased to have coped with this. The authorities of Kazakhstan provided full support. I do not see any barriers in this country. We are very pleased that we have received such an award,” said Zonenschein.

To participate in the event, 350 college and university students of 30 specialties arrived from all regions. The winners of the competition will represent Kazakhstan at the international championship in Kazan next year.

      The four-day national championship runs through 30 skills and is aimed at improving the quality of technical and vocational education. The event was organized by the Ministry of Education and Science in conjunction with the Kasipkor holding.
      Deputy Chairman of Kasipkor Asima Bimendina reported that the national championship is being held in Kazakhstan for the fourth time: the republic joined the WorldSkills International movement in 2014, a year later the first championship was held.
      “There are a lot of events that take place in our capital, but today's event occupies a special place, because young people participate in it — college students, future specialists, whom we prepare for various sectors of the country's economy. I want to say that the qualification of the participants is growing every time. The role of vocational education is increasing every day,” said Bimendina.
      According to the organizers, students from all 17 regions of the republic take part in this championship. In each competence, the main experts give participants a competitive task.
      The chief expert in Kazakhstan among culinary arts, the founder of the restaurant complex S. Adilkhanov, who stood at the origins of WorldSkills Kazakhstan, noted that holding this competition has a positive effect on the development of domestic technical and vocational education.
      “After the national championship, we went to the international championship in Brazil. Then (2015) we had only seven competencies. This was the beginning of Kazakhstan’s path in this movement. Tellingly, in the competence ‘Cooking’ the participant, for the first time taking part in the World Championship in Sao Paulo, brought Kazakhstan a medal. This is a big victory, as 74 countries participated and we entered the top 30 for ‘Cooking.’ In four years, the status of the movement has increased, now there are more than 30 competencies. We visited the Russian Federation, Belarus, participated in the EuroSkills in Budapest. Our participants are showing very good results on the world stage,” said Adilkhanov.
      The venue of the event is divided into 30 sectors, where all the necessary conditions for the demonstration of skills are created. For example, the kitchen for cooking has equipment that meets international standards. In the sector "CNC Turning" modern machines are installed.
      The representative of the Kasіpkor holding, the manager of the sector "Turning" A. Bozhenov said that everything is automated on these machines. Participants need to simply program the machine for a specific part, according to a drawing that the commission will offer them. Then the machine automatically performs the action to create the part.
      “This machine frees people from heavy mechanical work. People who have programming skills can easily master the work of a machine tool turner. If earlier this required heavy physical labor, now everything comes down to the skills of programming and maintaining the machine. This is a rather complicated technique, to work on it you need to know many specialized programs. We now have 10 participants from different regions. These are the best professionals, many of them were trained in Moscow. Now the production is being automated. If we want our production to correspond to the world level, then we need to develop this direction,” said Bozhenov.
      Contestants, in turn, shared their views on the importance of the event. This year a corner of the hotel business is presented at the site for the first time. A fourth-year student of the College of Industry, Tourism and Hospitality M. Bolgarina said that all the tasks of the championship allowed them to show the skill of working with the public.
      “Our competence has not yet reached such a level as, let’s say, hairdressing, cooking, because tourism, hotel business, service in Kazakhstan is only developing. At the WorldSkills site, the hotel business was introduced for the first time. When you work in a real hotel, you can feel the person, you can find an approach to her. For this, in college we are taught psychology, identifying the type of a person’s temperament, how to approach him, what he wants,” said Bolgarina.
      The championship takes place in 30 skills: “Brickworkб” “Painting and Decoratiтп,” “Pâtisserie and Confectionery,” “Electronics,” “Hotel Administration,” “CNC Turning,” “Web Design and Development,” “Graphic DesignTechnology,” “Maintenance and Repair of Diesel Engines," “Network and System Administration," “Fitter-Repairman of Agricultural Machines and Tractors,” “Mechatronics,” “Electrical Work,” “Visual Merchandising and Showcase,” “Repair and Maintenance of Cars,” “Plumbing and Heating,” “Restaurant Service,” “Engineering Graphics,” “Body Repair,” “Mobile Robotics,” "Hairdressing,” “Fashion Technology,” “Determining Grain Quality of and its Processing Products,” “Welding Technologies,” “Tiling,” “Dry Construction and Plastering,” “Cooking,” “Baking,” “Maintenance of Refrigeration and Ventilation Equipment,” “IT Solutions for Businesses.”

      More than 600 km of roads will put in operation in 2017, said Vice-Minister for Investment and Development Roman Sklyar  during a press conference in the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

      However, payment collection system is provided by 700 km of roads of national importance in 2017. These are sections on Astana - Temirtau, Almaty - Kapshagay and Almaty - Khorgos.
      The system in test mode will be launched in November this year. By 2020, it is planned to install payment collection system on 6 thousand km of roads of national significance, which will gather about 30 bn tenge.
      "The system will enable the board to move to self-sufficiency maintenance of roads and reduce the burden on the budget," R.Sklyar said.
      Vice Minister recalled that the only toll section operates in the republic since 2013. This sector is Astana - Schuchinsk stretching 217 km. The tariff approved in this sector is 1 tenge per kilometer of the car. R.Sklyar noted that it is not planned to increase this rate on new sites. Our legislation does not provide the construction of alternative sites.
      R.Sklyar stressed that the roads will be maintained in accordance with quality standards
      "Special studies are conducted regularly. According to the research saving fuel and other indicators are much higher than the fees, which we plan to charge for travel," Deputy Minister said.
      Particular attention will be given to high-quality infrastructure for the provision of services to users of motorways. This need has arisen due to the fact that there are over two thousand separate objects of road service along the roads of republican significance at the present time, most of which does not meet the adopted 2015 national standards.

      Extended meeting of the Presidium of the Atameken National Chamber of Entrepreneurs was held Dec. 5 in Astana with the participation of the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, where the results of the chamber’s work were summed up, and the issues in the implementation of the tasks set for business development in various sectors of the Kazakhstani economy were reviewed.

      In his speech, the Prime Minister Sagintayev noted that the day before, at a meeting of the Security Council chaired by the Head of State, the external challenges and threats, both economic and political, were raised. The Government presented its vision and inferences. At the same time, it is noted that this work can be done only together with the business community.
      At the meeting, key results of the joint work of the state and business were identified. So, since the early 2018, a new tax code has been in place that simplifies tax administration. From Jan. 1, 2019, a “tax amnesty” will be held for 89 thousand small and medium-sized businesses on accrued penalties and fines. At the same time, the threshold of criminal liability for tax offenses will rise (approx. from 20 thousand to 50 thousand MCI damage with replacement with administrative fines). These questions were carefully worked out with the Atameken Chamber.
      The new Customs Code, which has also been launched since the beginning of 2018, increases the transparency of procedures and reduces the rates of customs duties. The customs infrastructure for the development of international trade has been updated, the Nur Zholy automobile checkpoint with new types of equipment, has been launched on Khorgos.
      The systemic reforms introduced in the Business Code have already reduced checks by 76.6% (over the past eight years) – from 349 thousand to 81.6 thousand or more than fourfold. In addition, the control oversight of the business has been reduced. Control functions are reduced by 30%, and this work continues.
      According to the Prime Minister, digitalization provides great opportunities. More than 60% of state services have already been converted into electronic format, about 80% of them are provided by the Government for Citizens. The Astana Hub International Technopark was launched, on the site of which the Government, together with Atameken, plans to work on the further development of the technopark, which should become the center of the innovation ecosystem
      Incentives for e-commerce and an increase in the turnover of non-cash payments have been regulated legislatively. According to statistics, tens of thousands of new jobs are opening up in this area. The big question that is raised by both the society and the Parliament of Kazakhstan is the reduction of the shadow sector. Most of this is in the trade sector. In this regard, in order to get the business out of the shadows, the support of the business community itself in the implementation of policies and the strengthening of control over unscrupulous entrepreneurs who evade taxes are needed.
      In addition, the Head of State in his Address “Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Income and Quality of Life” instructed the Government to take measures to support the economy through additional funding. Thus, 600 billion tenge allocated by the National Bank will be aimed at ensuring long-term liquidity and lending to priority projects. The Government, together with the Atameken, worked out the mechanism, determined the corresponding product position, prepared a road map, participating banks, identified the tools. By the end of 2018, it is planned to select areas and projects that will be provided with support measures from early 2019.
      At the same time, the focus will be on projects that potentially have multiple economic and social benefits for the country.
      The Business Roadmap will be extended until 2025 with an additional allocation of 30 billion tenge annually. In addition, 500 billion tenge is directed to additional support for the manufacturing industry and non-primary exports over the next three years. Thus, all the necessary funds have been allocated for business development in priority sectors of the economy. A lot of work has been done on microcredit, all errors for 2018 have been eliminated. This will allow to reach all indicators on microcredit and microfinance in 2019.
      In order to develop agriculture further, the program of the agro-industrial complex has been updated. Every year, in addition to the funds provided for under the state program, 100 billion tenge will be allocated to this area. Along with this, today new markets for domestic products are opening up. In particular, a large Chinese market: the PRC Government proposed, by creating joint ventures with Chinese partners, to send Kazakhstani products through China to third countries in Southeast Asia.
      The Prime Minister drew particular attention to systemic issues that require direct participation and engagement of the country's business community. One of these issues is the social responsibility of business. It is indicated that obtaining support from the state requires appropriate business responsibility for the competitiveness of goods and services produced in terms of price and quality.
      Systemic issues also include the advancement of special economic zones, ensuring the availability of funds, access of large holdings and companies to government procurement, the development of mass entrepreneurship and productive employment, public-private partnerships, privatization, and tariff setting. In this sector, it is noted that the work carried out to reduce tariffs should not affect the quality of services provided and the reduction of the investment component.
      Concluding his speech, Sagintayev noted that the Atameken presented more than 500 problematic issues to the Government, and none of them went unheeded. Of the 552 questions, 506 were resolved, and some were excluded from the registry due to the loss of relevance. Thus, the overall work of the Government and Atameken yields its results: according to the Doing Business ranking, Kazakhstan took the 28th place, in the Parliament there is the seventh package of amendments on the development of entrepreneurship.
      The work done on 10 strategic objectives and upcoming plans until 2023 was reported by the deputy chairmen of the Atameken Rustam Zhursunov and Eldar Zhumagaziev.
      Zhursunov noted that in recent years the unprecedented work has been done to deregulate the business, the number of requirements was reduced, the state control system was optimized, as a result of which the one-time business costs were reduced by 600 billion tenge.
      In addition, the business will save about 5.5 billion annually. On the protection of business, over 25 thousand complaints were received, of which more than 43% were positively resolved. The total amount of financial rights saved (cancellation of penalties and fines) is more than 130 million tenge. Since 2014, systemic business problems have been solved: 605 issues have been identified, 427 of which have been resolved. In addition, over the past three years, criminal cases in the economic sphere have decreased by five times, which means that more than 20 thousand businessmen remained in economic circulation, retained their enterprises and jobs.
      The Deputy Chairman of Atameken National Chamber of Entrepreneurs Eldar Zhumagaziev, in turn, reported that 30 thousand people were trained under the Bastau project in 2018, 124 projects were financed. For 2.5 years, work has been carried out to develop its own microfinance system: in six regions, 1,900 projects have been funded for 7 billion tenge.
      “A lot has been done during this time, one thing is obvious — we have a clear idea in which direction to develop further. The key goal for the near future is to assist entrepreneurs in solving problems with financing, with sales, as well as with access to competences for solving legal issues. To do this, we will change the functional structure emphasizing the principles of customer-centeredness, focus and project approach,” said Zhumagaziev.
      Chairman of the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs Ablay Myrzakhmetov expressed gratitude for the support measures provided by the state with regard to business, especially the manufacturing sector.
      Myrzakhmetov identified five areas of the target economic model. These are monetary policy, a decline in the state’s share in the economy, a business climate in the regions, tax policy, and an increase in the effectiveness of government measures.
      Following the hearings of the reports, business representatives voiced a number of topical issues. The topics of restraining the unreasonable growth of prices for socially important food products, the course of the privatization program in the country, etc. were raised.
      Chairman of the Presidium of Atameken Timur Kulibayev, summing up the discussion, noted that in the five years of the chamber's work, the agenda had been synchronized: the Government supported the issues raised by business. At the same time, attention was paid to efficiency issues. A proposal was made to install a key performance indicators system for managers of holdings and government agencies that have the opportunity to make long-term purchases so that they can see which projects we can localize. This will increase the transparency of procurement in the quasi-public sector. In addition, the importance of supporting domestic producers in terms of presence in the Eurasian Economic Union was noted.
      Kulibayev thanked the deputies and the government for their systematic work and effective support, noting that a huge body of legislative initiatives was jointly implemented. The board maintains feedback with regions and all industry associations. Today, more than two-thirds of the issues have been resolved, the work continues for more than 100 of them.
      In his closing speech, Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev said that the questions from business on work in the regions that are open would be considered at a Government meeting. Attention was also paid to the prospects for expanding the presence of Kazakhstani products in foreign markets and the involvement of domestic entrepreneurs in integrated work to improve the quality of training.

      Nov. 29, 2018, Astana hosted the forum "Future of Labor Market: New Opportunities." This is the first thematic platform to discuss the prospects for the development of employment and the social sphere in Kazakhstan in the context of dynamic changes in the global labor market under the Fourth Industrial Revolution. During the plenary session, the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Bakytzhan Sagintayev addressed the participants.

      Dear ladies and gentlemen!
      I am glad to welcome you to our forum dedicated to the ongoing transformation of the labor market and the related challenges and opportunities. It is one of the most pressing issues today. Starting with the 2017 Address of the Head of State “Third Modernization of Kazakhstan: Global Competitiveness,” we have been very actively working on these issues. All these questions were raised at the intermediate session of foreign investors. We are very grateful to our expert guests who came to us and are ready today to share the suggestions that they have.
      The world is undergoing profound technological, economic and social changes. They go fast and change the whole way of life.
      We are closely following the analytics on the labor market’s future, and are familiar with the reports of the World Bank, the OECD, the World Economic Forum and the Asian Development Bank.
      Indeed, the global technological transition places new demands on the quality of human capital, skills and competence of the workforce, transforming labor markets.
      Kazakhstan is also building an open society and an open economy. Our development strategy is aimed at integrating the country into the top 30 most successful countries in the world. And we, of course, are faced with new global trends and challenges for the global labor market.
      First, the rapid digitalization and development such technologies as Industry 4.0, big data, artificial intelligence and robotics, are changing the structure of jobs.
      According to experts, about 4% or 140 million jobs may disappear until 2025. At the same time, 80-90% or about 3 billion jobs will become more complicated. The disappearance of the old and the complication of new professions puts on the agenda of national governments issues of compensating for the loss of jobs as a result of automation, ensuring the flexibility to acquire new skills in their countries' labor resources.
      Second, technology and innovation lead to the emergence of new professions and new industries, which means the creation of new jobs.
      According to the forecasts, about 10% (or 350 million) of jobs in the global labor market will be new professions. They will appear at the junction of traditional industries and innovations (for example, in medicine – “operator of medical robots” or in aviation – “controller of unmanned navigation”).
      Third, globalization and technological progress lead to the development of a gig economy, which already requires more flexible forms of employment, self-employment and the maximum involvement of vulnerable groups in the labor market.
      The labor market is transforming. The number of so-called freelancers is increasing. New formats are being expanded: part-time or flexible employment, collaboration, homework, annual hours. The inclusiveness of the labor force is increasing. The economic activity of women and persons with disabilities is growing.
      All these new challenges are not just a theory. The world is already facing them.
      Therefore, I hope that today's Forum will become an important platform for dialogue between experts, major employers and government agencies to discuss the future labor market; understand calls and find answers to them; effectively use new opportunities for building an economically strong and socially responsible state.
      Kazakhstan is actively shaping its policy to manage the changes and is trying to work ahead of the curve. President Nursultan Nazarbayev has already given strategic answers to global challenges.
      Institutional reforms of the “Nation’s Plan: 100 Concrete Steps” are being systematically implemented. To get closer to the best international practices, OECD standards are being introduced. In early 2017, the course of the Third Modernization of Kazakhstan was announced, aimed at creating a new model of economic growth based on technology and a new quality of human capital.
      The government has developed a special Strategic Development Plan until 2025, designed to ensure the growth of Kazakhstan’s economy at a rate higher than the growth of the world economy. At the same time it is planned to increase labor productivity by 50%; growth in non-primary exports to $41 billion and expand the share of small and medium-sized businesses in GDP to 35%.
      Of course, the solution of such tasks will require a very high level of professional training and motivation of people, building up the human capital of the nation. Therefore, the President of the country put forward the Five Social Initiatives and recently made a special addressed to the people of Kazakhstan, designed to provide new inclusive opportunities for citizens to improve their well-being and quality of life.
      The government of Kazakhstan has clear plans for the implementation of social tasks set by the Head of State. We expect that in the next 7 years, about 2 million graduates of colleges and universities will enter the national labor market, and all of them need to be provided with high-quality jobs.
      Therefore, first, we are working to create about a million jobs by 2025. For this purpose, project management has been introduced, jobs are being created not only in the basic industries, but also at the intersection of automation and digitalization of production, the implementation Industry 4.0 elements, the creation of new promising production areas and a service economy.
      Second, the Government has implemented the National Labor Forecasting System. Its main task is to proactively assess the demand and supply of labor, determine the need for personnel and create a system for their training and retraining.
      Now we are actively implementing the recommendations of the OECD for improving the National Qualifications System. By 2020, we will approve about 550 professional standards in all key sectors of the economy of Kazakhstan.
      Third, in order to provide employment, we have introduced mechanisms for managing the overflow of labor resources released as a result of technological modernization. In all regions, work is carried out with large enterprises.
      In addition, to increase the flexibility of the labor market, the Electronic Labor Exchange was launched Jan. 1, 2018: the first digital platform in the country, and the largest bank of vacancies and resumes in the country. All 200 state and 48 private employment agencies are connected to it, as well as a number of media outlets and online sites.
      Fourth, in order to provide employment and create jobs, the Government is implementing a program for developing large-scale entrepreneurship. From the early 2017, 190 billion tenge was allocated for these purposes. This made it possible to cover more than 1 million people with employment promotion measures, including 430 thousand this year. This work will continue.
      The Government of Kazakhstan expresses gratitude to the country's largest employers for the high degree of involvement in the implementation of state policy and support for government programs in the field of employment and labor market modernization.
      The largest investors and enterprises of the country are already implementing more than a hundred specific projects on technological modernization. Thus, the Eurasian Group and Kazakhmys are introducing technologies of “smart quarries” in a number of fields. The Digital Plant standard is implemented by Eurasian Foods companies in food production, Khimfram in pharmaceutical production, Kazmerells in the mining and metallurgical complex. Companies in the construction sector, such as the BI Group, are building housing according to the “smart home” standard.
      We also see that business is increasingly investing in retraining its staff. On the basis of the Polymetal company, a training Center for Mining Information Technologies was created, where Kazakh and foreign specialists are trained online. In Western Kazakhstan, oil companies have successfully established and operate training centers for personnel training.
      Today, in preparation for the 32nd Plenary Meeting of the Foreign Investors Council, we, with foreign investors, held an interim meeting on the development of human capital.
      We are launching a joint Roadmap for the development of vocational education. Together with such major enterprises as KNAUF, ERG, CLAAS, ArcelorMittal, Polymetal, Rusal, in each region of the country, competence centers will be created in the construction, mining and metallurgical, agricultural and other spheres on the basis of exemplary colleges. In the West of the country, the oil companies Karachaganak Petroleum Operating, Agip, CTR, Tengizchevroil, NCOC, Exxonmobil and Kazmunaygas have already successfully established training centers for personnel. We are also grateful to the international companies PwC, EY for their expert support in developing the best solutions for training competitive personnel.
      Such a partnership with business will give impetus to the development of human capital in the conditions of technological modernization and will increase the flexibility of the labor market. We call on all investors and employers to join this work!
      Dear participants! I hope our dialogue will allow us to exchange a vision on the most pressing issues of modernizing the labor market.
      We are interested in the opinions of experts and practitioners on how the personnel training system in Industry 4.0 should be transformed in Kazakhstan, how to integrate new forms of employment, adapt social protection systems and ensure inclusivity in the labor market.
      I wish productive work, success in professional and personal life to all the participants of the forum.
      Thank you for attention.

Now in the republic there will be such a system for controlling the issuance of sick leave. Information about the sick leave will immediately go to your employer automatically, thus there is no need to carry it on paper. And the falsification of sick leave will automatically disappear,” said Ospanov.

      The Day of the First President is a national holiday for the Kazakh people, who annually emphasize the importance of the status of an independent state and gratitude to Nursultan Nazarbayev for his outstanding achievements in the development of the state policy, promotion of the country on the world stage. In the material of PrimeMinister.kz, famous experts told about the significance of this day and the role of the First President in the life and development of Kazakhstan.

      Historical path of the development of Kazakhstan as a state is directly associated with the name of the First President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Thanks to the wisdom and political will of the Head of State, Kazakhstan was able to create a coherent strategy for economic development. Nazarbayev forever went down in history as a man whose name is associated with the achievements of sovereign Kazakhstan. Serving the people in the name of prosperity is the main message of the entire political work of the First President and the meaning of his whole life.
      As Deputy Director of the Kazakhstan Institute for Strategic Studies under the President Sanat Kushkumbayev noted that the peacemaking initiatives of Kazakhstan and the Kazakhstani leader are the “classic signature dish” of Kazakhstani foreign policy. First of all, this is nuclear non-proliferation and the contribution of the President of Kazakhstan, who pays special attention to this issue is widely known. By the decree of the President of Aug. 29, 1991, the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site was closed, which was the fateful decision for the entire Kazakh people. It is for this decision that Nursultan Nazarbayev forever entered world history as a politician who made a tremendous personal contribution to the struggle for nuclear non-proliferation.
      “Another important aspect is that Astana has become a globally significant negotiating platform, that is, a kind of Asian Geneva, where various parties are negotiating. The Syrian 11th round of negotiations showed its effectiveness; really important issues that concern millions of Syrians were considered. It was here, in Astana, thanks to the geopolitical efforts of Kazakhstan that the negotiations took place and became productive for the guarantor countries,” said Kushkumbayev.
      According to the expert, an important factor is also the strategy chosen by Kazakhstan initially
      multi-vector diplomacy, a cooperative approach based on interaction and dialogue.
      “Therefore, the entire foreign policy of Kazakhstan is designed to take part in various structures and associations with an open format, ready for dialogue. Thanks to this, Kazakhstan manages to establish relations with world leaders who are in opposition to each other,” Kushkumbayev added.
      An expert of the Institute of World Economy and Politics under the Foundation of the First President of Kazakhstan
      Elbasy, A. Zharylgapova, said that the Day of the First President is an opportunity to highlight and note the significant contribution of Elbasy to the development of Kazakhstan.
      “The President was at the forefront of the formation of the whole statehood. And it was a difficult time for the people when the system that operated in the Soviet Union could no longer provide stability and prosperity. At the beginnings of independence, under the wise leadership of Nursultan Nazarbayev, virtually from scratch, many state institutions were created, the main law of the country, the Constitution, the national currency – tenge, introduced the transition to a market economy, the transfer and construction of the new capital Astana. Since then, there have been many events in the domestic and foreign policy of the Republic, thanks to which today Kazakhstan in the international arena is rightfully considered one of the most dynamically developing countries in the world. Thus, in 2018, Kazakhstan ranked 36th among 190 countries in the Doing Business World Bank ranking,” Zharylgapova said.
      In her opinion, the signing by the President of the decree on the closure of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site and the rejection of the world's fourth nuclear arsenal was also one of the important tools for ensuring the peace policy of Kazakhstan. This allowed Kazakhstan to consolidate the image of a state promoting peace initiatives and dialogue in addressing critical issues of global security. Thus, in 1992, the President of Kazakhstan, at the 47th session of the UN General Assembly, announced the idea of ​​convening a Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia. Today, there are 26 Member States, which make up 90% of the territory and population of the continent.
      “Another confirmation of this is the successful holding of negotiations in the capital to resolve the situation in Syria. The eleventh round of the Astana process has recently ended. The recognition by the world community of the significant role of Kazakhstan and the activities of the President in security matters was demonstrated in 2017, when Kazakhstan became the first Central Asian state elected to the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member. As part of the chairmanship, special attention was paid to issues of general disarmament and countering terrorism,” she noted.
      In general, according to Zharylgapova, among the success factors of the policy pursued by the President is the unwavering leadership in the idea of ​​building a democratic peaceful society that is open to innovation and technological progress, and also seeks for mutually beneficial cooperation with countries of both the near and far abroad.
      In turn, the head of Sociological and Image Research Program, an expert of the Institute of World Economy and Politics at the Foundation of the First President, Serik Beisembayev, said that the results of regular sociological research show a consistently high level of public support for Nursultan Nazarbayev.
      “The following main factors of loyalty of citizens towards the President of the country can be singled out: first, Kazakhstanis have noted an increase in the standard of living of the population as a result of economic growth since the early 2000s. During this time, in the opinion of the majority, the consumer capacities of citizens have improved, and qualitative infrastructural changes have taken place. Nowadays, the Head of State’s initiatives in the social sphere, associated with wage increases, housing affordability and creating conditions for young people, enjoy high support,” he informed.
      Secondly, as Beisembayev noted, for citizens the political stability in the country is very important, especially in the sphere of inter-ethnic relations. Kazakhstanis note that the socio-economic achievements in the country have been made in large part thanks to conflict-free development and social harmony in the country.
      “Thirdly, the public support of the President derives from his personal qualities. Citizens are impressed by the charisma and strong-willed character of the Head of State. Recent studies have shown that Nursultan Nazarbayev responds to the needs of Kazakhstan citizens regarding what an ideal political leader should be. This applies to both business and personal qualities. So, for example, the most important image characteristics of the president are ‘wise,’ ‘far-sighted’ and ‘diplomatic,” the expert emphasized.
      In general, according to Beisembayev, a high level of trust in Nursultan Nazarbayev is one of the main factors for the stability of the political system in Kazakhstan. The symbolic capital accumulated by the President extends to other branches of the government, thereby giving stability to the entire political structure in the country.
      Director of the Expert Institute of European Law and Human Rights Marat Bashimov also noted the high importance of the First President on the world stage and the peacekeeping role of Kazakhstan in international politics.
      “Peace-loving policy that Kazakhstan adheres to is based on friendly relations with all countries, both with the Turkic world and with the European Union, China, Russia and the United States. The international community widely recognizes Nursultan Nazarbayev as a world leader,” said Bashimov.
      According to him, over the years of independence under the leadership of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakh people with their persistent and constructive work managed to find the right path of development. Thanks to the wise policy of the President, today the economy of our country is steadily and dynamically developing, the well-being of the population is improving, the sociopolitical stability of the society is preserved.
      Recall that the Day of the First President was established in December 2011, in accordance with the law adopted by the Senate of the Parliament “On Amendments to the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan ‘On Holidays in the Republic of Kazakhstan.” Holiday has been celebrated in the country since 2012. Dec. 1, 1991, as a result of the first national elections, Nazarbayev was reelected as president of the Kazakh SSR. One of the first steps of the first president was the signing of the law on renaming the Kazakh SSR to the Republic of Kazakhstan Dec. 10, 1991. And six days later, Dec. 16, the Supreme Soviet declared independence, which meant the proclamation of Kazakhstan as a sovereign state. The first December days of 1991 became crucial for the country and determined the development of an independent Republic.

      Independence is the people's main value. From the first days of sovereignty, Kazakhstan has been following a confident path of development and prosperity, which lead to large-scale achievements and successes in all spheres of the life of society and the state.

      It was during the years of independence that Kazakhstan reached qualitatively new frontiers in all sectors of the national economy. Experts told РrimeМinister.kz about the importance of this historical event and the achievements of Kazakhstan for 27 years.
      Thanks to the independence and wise policy of peace and concord of the Head of State Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan is among the strongest states in the world. The model of dynamic development brought the country to the front ranks of the fast-growing states of the world. Today it is impossible to underestimate the historical power of the choice made by the people of Kazakhstan in 1991 — the choice to live in a free, independent country, in peace, harmony and trust with each other, to determine their own destiny, the life of subsequent generations and build their successful future. From the first days of independence, Kazakhstan has set itself the goal of building a legal democratic state and a just civil society, in which the main person is his rights and interests.
      Alua Zholdybalina, head of the department of social and political research at the Kazakhstan Institute for Strategic Studies under the President, believes that the notion of independence is sacred to Kazakhstanis.
      “Our people well feel, understand and appreciate the dignity and importance of our independence. Independence provided us with an excellent opportunity to conduct our own policy in our country and position ourselves as a member of the international community,” said Zholdybalina.
      Also, according to the expert, the development of regions is of great importance in the growth of a strong state.
      “One of the achievements of independence is the level of development of our regions. The economic and social potential, achievements and quality of life in the regions of the country contribute to the stable and balanced development of the united Kazakhstan. The prosperity of each region is the prosperity of Kazakhstan, which means that in the future each region should become a region with its own brand, development features and economic orientation. Economically strong and socially developed regions are the key to the sustainable development of Kazakhstan,” the expert noted.
      Experts of the Institute of World Economy and Politics under the Foundation of the First President of Kazakhstan - Elbasy, in turn, spoke about the role and position of Kazakhstan in the world community, and also noted the wide opportunities that have been opened to Kazakhstanis thanks to independence.
      According to the expert Zhumabek Sarabekov, for 27 years of independence, the republic has gone through a very complicated and interesting way to strengthen its statehood and develop its national potential. Having successfully coped with the task of transition to a market economy, the country was able to lay the foundations for sustainable economic growth. Kazakhstan managed to build a new system of government, which ensured the implementation of large-scale social reforms.
      “Kazakhstan is deservedly regarded as a state distinguished by the harmonious and stable development of inter-ethnic relations. Thanks to all this, Astana today is a recognized leader in Central Asia. Thus, over the years of independence, the national economy has grown 20 times, which allowed Kazakhstan to become one of the 50 most competitive economies in the world. In addition, Kazakhstan was able to create real favorable conditions for doing business — over 27 years of independence, more than 300 billion foreign direct investments were sent to Kazakhstan. According to this indicator, we are the leaders among the post-Soviet states,” said Sarabekov.
      As the expert noted, it is also important that over the years Kazakhstan has managed to overcome the “geography” trap. Location far from the world's oceans was previously considered by many to be a weakness of Kazakhstan, but through large-scale modernization of the transport infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and railways, as well as the development of port facilities, the country is gradually turning into a land bridge between Europe and Asia.
      It should be noted that a verified and strategically competent foreign policy has become an important guarantee for the stable internal development of Kazakhstan. Being at the junction of the geopolitical interests of such major powers as Russia, China, the European Union and the United States, Kazakhstan was able to build equidistant relations with all centers of power. And today, Astana is positioning itself as an authoritative subject of international relations, which makes a serious contribution to strengthening strategic stability and security.
      At the same time, as Sarabekov emphasized, at the present stage of development, new challenges are emerging for Kazakhstan.
      “Today we are facing an aggravation of the geopolitical struggle between the powers. Its negative consequence is a sharp narrowing of the space for maneuvers. The global economy is experiencing a rollback of globalization, which can lead to serious disruptions in the entire global supply chain. At the same time, fundamental changes are taking place in the technological structure, which are accompanied by the large-scale introduction of IT into industry and a departure from obsolete production. All these factors dictate the need for further modernization of Kazakhstan and structural reforms,” said the expert.
      Experts of the Institute of World Economy and Politics Radik Temirgaliyev stressed that for each person independence is, first of all, his personal freedom.
      “This is an opportunity to freely receive information, freedom of self-realization. People are free to do business, creativity, etc. Now Kazakhstanis can be found all over the world. People are free to study, work, live in foreign countries. This is, after all, comfort,” the expert concluded.

      2019 is declared by the Head of State the Year of Youth in Kazakhstan. Head of the Sociological and Image Research Program of the World Economy and Politics Institute under the Foundation of the First President Serik Beisembayev shared his expert opinion on the role of youth organizations and the importance of developing state support for volunteers.

      According to the expert, in Kazakhstan with the announcement of the Year of Youth, new opportunities are opening for the transformation of youth policy in the country. The main vector of changes will be associated with the systematization of the work being done, as well as increasing the targeting of state assistance for various groups of young people.
      “First of all, the state seeks to streamline the measures that are aimed at addressing issues of youth employment. There are several programs in the country, for example, Zhasyl El, ‘With a Diploma – to the Village,’ etc. There are Youth Resource Centers that help young people to find jobs. Despite this, as our research shows, employment remains the No. 1 problem for Kazakhstani youth. The new initiatives announced by the President are intended to focus the attention of government agencies on this problem, as well as to increase the effectiveness of existing programs,” said Beisembayev.
      At the same time, the state plans to increase the accessibility of education in the following years. This is especially important for young people from villages and small towns.
      “The development of the system of secondary special education will help increase the level of adaptation of this category of young people. Here it is important that the quality of education meets the demands of the market,” he stressed.
      In addition, as the expert noted, the youth policy in the country seeks to support the new trend to increase the social activity of young people. Supporting volunteers through material incentives, the state not only directs youth activity in a positive direction, but also sets a new direction for youth organizations.
      “As we can see from the example of large cities, there are more and more initiatives to improve public spaces, help the poor, improve environmental awareness, etc. The new generation is very interested in participating in such projects,” he said.
      Thus, it is important that in the Year of Youth in Kazakhstan, the problems of youth will be actualized at the highest level. Those issues that are raised are complex and their solution will help increase human capital in general. And this is a key priority of social policy in Kazakhstan.
      Recall that in the Address “Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Incomes and Quality of Life,” President Nursultan Nazarbayev announced the Year of Youth. During 2019, measures will be taken to fully support and implement the state youth policy.

      The 31st plenary session of the Foreign Investors’ Council chaired by the President of Kazakhstan N. Nazarbayev is held June 6 in Astana. The subject of the plenary session is "Accelerated Modernization." In his speech, the President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Suma Chakrabarti described the three breakthrough investment areas in Kazakhstan.

      "This is the annual meeting of the Foreign Investors’Council, I believe this is a very important date for each participant. I think that the transformation that is taking place in the country is incredible. Kazakhstan is really a country with an average income level and this new status brings new interesting opportunities and puts new risks. We need to strengthen work in accelerating modernization, it is especially important to talk about future cooperation between Kazakhstan and the EBRD. Today we see when two partners work on a common goal and reach it," Chakrabarti said.
      For all the years of cooperation, the EBRD's investments in Kazakhstan amounted to about $9 billion.
      "Together we are trying to speed up the modernization. This gives us very high hopes for its acceleration. I would like to point out three main areas. I would call them breakthrough. I would like to congratulate all those who took part in the signing of investment agreements on PPP BAKAD. This is the first project in Central Asia that works on the basis of modern international practices, gives a powerful signal to the world that Kazakhstan can attract more foreign direct investment," the EBRD president said.
      Secondly, Suma Chakrabarti noted Kazakhstan's progress in the field of renewable energy. The transfer of Kazakhstan's economy to green lines is vital for the modernization of the country and makes Kazakhstan even more competitive.
      "Today, a joint project of the Clean Technology Fund and the EBRD allows us to finance new solar installations, and we have already signed a new project worth $38 million," Chakrabarti said.
      The third successful investment sphere is the Astana International Financial Centre.
      "This is a big priority in the EBRD's work. We are very excited about the potential of the AIFC," Suma Chakrabarti said.
      Also during his speech at the plenary session, the EBRD head expressed his admiration for the pace of Kazakhstan's development.
      "The admiration for Astana and Kazakhstan as a whole is something I always note when I come here. It's worth it. I am very proud to be a co-chairman of the Foreign Investors’ Council, and I heartily welcome the further changes that are taking place now, as well as the dialogue between investors and the Government of the country. Such a dialogue, I believe, plays a crucial role in accelerating our work to modernize Kazakhstan," he said.
      In an interview with the reporters of PrimeMinister.kz, Suma Chakrabarti noted that he has come to Kazakhstan for the sixth year already.
      "I like that Kazakhstan always develops, all the time in motion. Plus it is the progressive dynamics. It learns from other countries, shows some lessons for other countries. Here, of course, we cannot fail to recognize the importance of leadership of the Head of State and a strong team of ministers, as well as the younger generation that shapes the future, the private sector. I look very optimistic about Kazakhstan's further future," Suma Chakrabarti said.

      Housing problems have always been relevant. With the launch of the new Mortgage Program “7-20-25” in Kazakhstan, this issue has been among the leaders. Many Kazakhstanis are thinking about purchasing housing under this program. Meanwhile, to date about 100 people have already obtained loans on favorable terms.

      Vice Minister for Investments and Development of Kazakhstan Kaiyrbek Uskenbayev, in an interview with Primeminister.kz, spoke about the implementation of the housing program 7-20-25, its impact on the Nurly Zher State Program and presented the first results of the work done.
      — The Nurly Zher program, implemented since 2017 and the mortgage program 7-20-25 started in July 2018, do not interfere with each other, but, on the contrary, working in parallel create new opportunities for citizens to improve their living conditions:
      1) The purpose of the program 7-20-25 is to provide the population with mortgages at low interest rate to buy housing in new buildings. It is a mechanism of cheap resources and everyone who works can buy an apartment on credit. Its main conditions: the interest rate on the loan is reduced to 7% per annum, the initial contribution is not more than 20%, and to reduce the burden on paying a monthly payment, the loan period is extended to 25 years.
      2) At the same time, the purpose of the State Housing Construction Program "Nurly Zher" is the integrated solution of housing issues of the population, through the implementation of its five tasks:
      - construction of rental housing without a ransom,
      - construction of credit housing,
      - development of individual housing construction,
      - stimulation of housing construction by private developers,
      - construction of housing with the involvement of subjects of the quasi-public sector.
      By the decree of the Government of June 22, 2018, a number of changes were made to the Nurly Zher program.
      So, in connection with the introduction of 7-20-25, the direction on subsidizing mortgages of citizens with the preservation of obligations to pay subsidies on concluded contracts have been excluded from the housing program (more than 3 thousand people purchased housing on preferential mortgage).
      In order to increase the supply of new housing and to ensure the growing volumes of construction, measures have been taken to increase the financing of infrastructure construction to the areas of housing construction.
      For the active participation of private developers in the program, the akimats are given the right to purchase the constructed facilities.
      The possibility to purchase credit housing is provided for depositors of Housing Construction Savings Bank, as well as for customers of second-tier banks.
      There are provisions for state and non-state enterprises to support their employees. Such organizations will be able to issue housing loans to employees, including as a down payment. This is a significant help for solving the housing problems of teachers, doctors and civil servants.
      All these conditions will give a greater impetus to the development of the mortgage program due to affordable price parameters for which akimats build housing (at prices of 140-180 thousand tenge per square meter, the constructed housing is sold to depositors of the bank for three months and the balance of unrealized housing to customers of second-tier banks).
      — It should be noted here that these programs can not be compared, they complement each other and are designed to solve the housing problems of people in need of various categories of citizens.
      At the same time, one of the main distinctive features of the programs is financing measures.
      If the Nurly Zher program provides for the participation of all sources of financing, both budgetary and attracting private investments and household funds, within the framework of the 7-20-25, the established Baspana mortgage company is engaged in placing funds in second-tier banks (due to the repurchase of the rights of claims of second-tier banks).
      Both programs provide opportunities for all solvent citizens who need housing and do not own housing.
      At the same time, for the low-income, socially vulnerable segments of the population, the program Nurly Zher provides for the construction and provision of rental housing without redemption and inexpensive lending by the akimats.
      — According to the National Bank, as of July 18, 2018, starting from July 4, 2018, the participating banks received 5,528 applications from citizens, of which 148 applications were submitted to the credit committee and 95 mortgage loans were granted for 1.1 billion tenge.
      Since the mortgage program started only in July, it's too early to talk about its viability. At the same time, its viability depends on various facts:
      - presence of the initial payment;
      - confirmation of solvency;
      - lack of housing in the property;
      - availability of primary housing for purchase and compliance with other program requirements.
      — It is natural that demand will generate supply, and there is a demand, and after the introduction of the program7-20-25 it will only increase.
      So, today only the number of citizens officially registered akimats is 492,500, people with housing deposits in the Savings Bank — more than 1 million investors. At the same time, there is a number of unregistered citizens who need housing, who are not registered in the above-mentioned queues.
      According to the results of the first half of 2018, 49,700 dwellings were put into operation under the Nurly Zhol, of which 20,500 are individual houses and 29,000 — apartments in multi-storey houses. Until the end of the year it is planned to build another 54 thousand dwellings.
      Over the 5-year period, with the attraction of 1 trillion tenge by the National Bank it is expected to issue more than 66,000 loans to the population for the purchase of new housing (it was calculated that the average amount of one mortgage is 15 million tenge).
      The above measures to update the mechanisms of the Nurly Zher program will stimulate the construction of housing.
      — Indeed, there is an issue of queues in this bank and not only after the introduction of the program 7-20-25, but also during the period of holding various actions of the bank, the implementation of its own My Home program, the solution of housing issues of servicemen, and also at the end of the year. People trust this bank and make savings, since the state holds a stake, state premiums for savings are provided, tax incentives are provided, and a flexible system of loans (housing, preliminary and interim loans) is provided.
      According to the Savings Bank, after the launch of the new housing program, the number of clients in the branches increased several times.
      The largest of them in Astana and Almaty serve from 1,500 to 1,800 clients a day.
      The bank now provides enough tools and methods for obtaining advice outside the office, and it is not necessary to go to the bank.
      In addition to consulting and receiving applications for the program 7-20-25 in the Astana branches of the Savings Bank, more than 300 loans are being issued within the Nurly Zher program. In addition, 162 apartments are being realized under the My Home program. Also, the bank is now actively working with military personnel. In Astana, it serves about 3,500 of their special accounts.
      To reduce queues in branches, especially after participating in the program 7-20-25, as well as for convenience and saving time, Housing Construction Savings Bank sent a memo to a number of organizations — brief information on lending within the "7-20-25".
      A video call service for citizens' consultations has been organized, as well as a mobile group to provide free services in the form of a visit with presentations and conclusions of agreements for opening deposits (for example, a personal consultant of the bank, you can contact all of the following phone numbers: +7 707 103 53 87, +7 702 502 45 17, +7 777 673 52 30).
      The first 8 mobile groups are already formed in Almaty, in the near future other regions will join (contacts of mobile groups in Almaty: 8 701 186 73 34, 8 777 188 20 88).
      There are part-time employees, to invite them at a convenient time, follow the
      , select a city, agent and contact him.
      Also, the call center of the bank at 300 is available for consultations, use the Feedback form on the website
      or contact the bank through the official pages on social networks on
      ,

      At the same time, the ministry conducts explanatory work together with the media and on the websites of TV channels and print media an answer to any question of interest can be found there.
      Also on the website of the Prime Minister, in the special section of JSC National Information Technologies on the
      of Electronic Government, in the Krysha newspaper you can get acquainted with the instructions (steps) for realizing your dream — purchase housing.
      The
      of the National Bank contains information on the most frequently asked questions on the program 7-20-25.
      — In connection with the introduction of the program 7-20-25, the direction "increasing the availability of mortgage lending" is excluded from the Nurly Zher housing program. At the same time, for the period of activity in this direction, 3,336 citizens purchased housing under a preferential mortgage, of which in 2017 — 1,196 people, in 2018 — 2,140 people.
      In connection with the above mentionad facts, loans to citizens for the purchase of housing will now be provided within the framework of the mortgage program 7-20-25, where for the 5-year period it is planned to attract 1 trillion tenge (in 2018 — 100 billion tenge, in 2019 — 150 billion tenge, in 2020 — 200 billion tenge, in 2021 — 250 billion tenge, in 2022 — 300 billion tenge).
      In 2018, under the 7-20-25 program, with 100 billion tenge of raised funds, participating banks plan to issue about 6,600 loans with an average amount of one loan for 15 million tenge.
      — In 2018, it is planned to commission at least 12.1 million square meters of housing, which is 108% to the level of 2017 (last year 11.2 million square meters or 100,800 housing units were built).

      At the press conference in the press center of the Government, Vice Minister of Finance Ruslan Beketayev explained how the changes made to the law will affect the quality of public procurement and procurement of the quasi-public sector.

      Recall, today at a meeting of the Government, issues of public procurement and procurement in the quasi-public sector were considered. Earlier, Dec. 26, 2018, the Head of State signed the law “On Amendments and Additions to Certain Legislative Acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Public Procurement and Procurement of the Quasi-Public Sector,” which came into effect Jan. 1, 2019.
      One of the innovations is that the site of public procurement became paid. According to the Vice Minister of Finance Ruslan Beketayev, setting fees for the services of the public procurement website is a very important aspect. The value of the established price is very available today. It starts from 1 MCI for those companies that will deal with purchases of up to 1 million tenge, and will grow differentially — 10 MCI, 20 MCI, 60 MCI, etc. Accordingly, the amount in those purchases in which companies can participate will also increase.
      Beketayev answered the questions of journalists about the purpose of the introduction of this innovation. Firstly, in order to improve the services that the government procurement portal provides today. Secondly, the innovation will cut off unscrupulous participants.
      “When a business had the opportunity to participate in procurement for free, we saw that we had about 225 thousand organizations registered on the portal, which in fact did not supply, but simply participated in tenders for some obscure purposes, then wrote complaints accordingly. Today, with the introduction of fees, we see that about 25 thousand companies participate in the procurement. The quality of potential participants today has become much higher and, accordingly, these participants, paying for the portal service, already require the corresponding quality of service. We see behind this the possibility of development and portal solutions,” said Beketayev.
      In addition, the new law provides for the repetition of public procurement procedures following the results of failed tenders. The Vice Minister spoke about how this rule affects the timing of procedures and mastering.
      According to him, the need for repeat public procurement procedures was due to the fact that the Ministry of Finance as a developer had the task to reduce the number of purchases from one source.
      “Having introduced this standard, we believe that the number of purchases from one source should be significantly reduced, but realizing that rather long procedures take an average of 45 days, we have to offer a new way to build state budget funds in time. If earlier it was chosen independently by a state institution, today it is determined by the Ministry of Finance in accordance with the legislation and this method is called ‘With prequalification,” said Beketayev.
      Thus, all construction companies will be selected according to the criteria developed by the Ministry of Finance together with the Atameken National Chamber of Entrepreneurs. Based on the selection results, a register of qualified suppliers will be created.
      “When a state institution wants to announce competitive procedures, say, for construction, it will only set the price parameter. We calculated that, on average, the length of the procedures will be reduced three times — this will be up to 15 days,” said the vice minister.
      In case of repeated procedures, even “With prequalification,” the deadlines will be a maximum of 30 days. The main objective of introducing this standard is to reduce purchases from one source. Because this method of procurement is uncompetitive.

      A briefing was held at the press center of the Government with the participation of the Vice Minister for Investments and Development, Kairbek Uskenbayev.

      The strategic need for the development of agglomerations with centers in Astana, Almaty, Aktobe and Shymkent is indicated by the Head of State in the Kazakhstan-2050 Strategy. In this regard, the Interregional Scheme for the Territorial Development of the Shymkent Agglomeration was developed for the controlled growth of the region's territory, which was approved today at the meeting of the Government.
      At the briefing, Kairbek Uskenbayev answered questions from media representatives in addition to the statements of the Minister for Investments and Development Zhenis Kassymbek and the akim of the South Kazakhstan region, Zhanseit Tuimebayev, mentioned at the meeting of the Government.
      In particular, journalists asked what influence the Shymkent agglomeration scheme will have on the development of local roads.
      According to Kairbek Uskenbayev, cities and villages within each metropolitan area should develop according to the fourth level. A decision was made to finance the maintenance of local roads by 50% by the akimats. If they fulfill these conditions, the missing 50% will be financed by the state represented by the Ministry for Investments and Development.
      "The development of agglomeration will have a positive impact on all spheres of life of the population of the region," the Vice Minister believes.
      So, new schools and preschool institutions will be built. It will affect not only the regional center and the major cities of the region, but it will reach every settlement within the agglomeration.
      Development of industrial zones and Ontustyk SEZ will form the basis for cluster development of such priority sectors of the agglomeration economy in the future as pharmaceuticals, machine building and construction industry. The transition from small-commodity to medium and large-scale commodity production, which can become a city-forming base, will reduce the outflow of the rural population.

      Today at the press conference following the meeting of the Government, the Minister for Investments and Development, Zhenis Kassymbek, answered questions from media representatives about the implementation of payment on the highways of national importance within the framework of Nurly Zhol state program.

      To date, only one route operates in paid mode — it is Astana-Shchuchinsk route.
      "Within the framework of the Nurly Zhol program, the Ministry is carrying out construction works on the installation of a charging system at the sections Astana-Temirtau, Almaty-Kapshagai and Almaty-Khorgos, with completion in April this year. The system is scheduled to be launched in the second quarter of this year," said Zhenis Kassymbek.
      It is planned that the roads will be completely transferred to the stationary paid mode in June this year.
      At the same time, design and estimate documentation is being developed to establish a charging system at 13 sections with a total length of 5500 km, including on Western Europe - Western China international corridor.
      The implementation of these projects is planned by the mechanism of public-private partnership with the conclusion of a PPP contract in the second half of this year.
      In general, until 2020, it is planned to increase toll roads to 6.5 thousand km, which will provide about 30 billion tenge annually.
      "30 billion tenge, which we are planning to receive from toll roads in 2021-2022, will come to the budget. They will be spent on the maintenance of roads. Today toll roads are built at the expense of the state-owned company Kazavtozhol or because they were laid in the project. Accordingly, this money will be used only for the maintenance of roads. In the long term, we plan that 5.5 thousand km, we will additionally, by the PPP principle, transfer to toll roads. Private money will be attracted there, the collection from these roads will flow to the accounts of state companies, to the budget and will be spent only on maintenance," the minister explained.
      At the same time, the money that the investor spent on the PPP project will be repaid to him in equal parts from the budget.
      "There are the so-called CICs — compensation of investment costs. They are determined by feasibility study. Then during the contest and negotiations," said Zhenis Kassymbek. In addition, the minister noted that the revenues to the budget from toll roads will be high, even despite the payment of compensation to investors.
      Recall, today at the meeting of the Government chaired by the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, the
      of the implementation of Nurly Zhol State Program for 2017 and work plans for the current year were considered.

      Jan. 17 at the press conference in the press center of the Government Vice Minister of Industry and Infrastructure Development Kairbek Uskenbayev spoke about the work being done to improve the quality of housing built in the country. In particular, he spoke about improving the procedure of state acceptance of finished housing.

      First of all, Uskenbayev focused on explaining the state acceptance procedure.
      “The state reception is when a ‘runner list’ from about 20 services, is assembled in akimat. Then people run around to sign it. Those people who run have never been at a construction site, and it is difficult to say that they were responsible for this quality. Therefore, we have changed the structure. Who is responsible for the quality? First of all — the one who issued the technical project; the second is the designer; the third is the builder; fourth — technical supervision, which is obliged to check; the fifth is the State Architectural and Construction Control, which, on behalf of the state, exercises control over the construction progress,” said the vice minister.
      According to the speaker, now five institutions are directly responsible for the quality of construction. In this regard, administrative and criminal liability was introduced. Thus, whose mistake and at what stage was made, he must bear personal responsibility.
      As part of the execution of the Head of State’s order for acceptance on the example of Astana, at the three facilities of the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development, digitization of the technological cycle in the entire construction industry is carried out. To date, this software product is ready for almost 90%.
      Uskenbayev noted that earlier the acceptance process took place in paper format. The customer provided the construction company with design and estimate documentation, which, as the vice minister noted, was huge. In a construction company, technical supervision, foremen lead a magazine of construction works. So everything is compiled in the paper version, then at the end of the construction is given, printed and packaged.
      “Now in the blockchain system: all the constructions of our country will be on the electronic portal. If someone wants to build – he should officially upload the design and estimate documentation to the portal. Technical supervision, foremen and all those involved, receive electronic keys. All interested parties came to see for themselves what construction equipment is working at the facility, what decisions are made on technology, what building materials are used. If there are comments, they are left in electronic format. In this system all public services that are needed will be connected. The whole country will see in real mode how this construction is proceeding,” said Uskenbayev.
      At the same time, answering the question about citizens' access to the data portal, the vice minister noted that participants in shared construction will be able to assess the quality of construction at all stages.
      “Whoever participates in shared construction should have the access. He should see the progress of construction, at what stage and of what quality. Now we are already implementing it in pilot mode at three sites in Astana. In 2019 we will put into commercial operation. From 2019 we will try to project on all the construction projects in our country,” the speaker concluded.

      At the press conference in the press center of the Government, Vice Minister of National Economy Serik Zhumangarin spoke about the work being done to reduce tariffs and enhance transparency of tariff setting under the instructions given by the Head of State at the Security Council Nov. 7, 2018.

      Zhumangarin reported that since Nov. 12, 2018, the feedback with the population has been established in all regions, which resulted in 102 public receptions on problematic issues in the housing sector with the participation of the media, akimats, Atameken NCE, Nur Otan Party, public associations and other interested parties. About 3 thousand people took part in the work of these receptions.
      Hotline telephones are organized for consumers who do not have the opportunity to attend public reception rooms.
      “After considering received appeals and complaints, as well as in order to identify unjustifiably received income by monopolists and return them to consumers, 55 unscheduled inspections of monopolists have already been opened. Another 15 unscheduled inspections are to be opened,” said Zhumangarin.
      According to the vice minister, as a result of the work done, in all regions a reduction in utility tariffs is expected: water supply, water drainage, electricity supply, heat supply and gas supply.
      According to the ministry, as of Dec. 20, 2018, heat tariffs have already been reduced in three regions:
      In addition, from Jan. 1, 2019, it is projected to decrease tariffs in the remaining 14 regions from 2.2% in the Karaganda region, to 15.3% — in the Turkestan region. As a result, the savings of public funds for heat supply services will be about 6 billion tenge.
      “From Jan. 1, 2019, under the marginal tariffs, we expected an increase in tariffs in all regions for all these five types of services (water supply, water disposal, power, heat and gas supply). After the work of the authorized and local executive bodies with natural monopolies, tariff increases from Jan. 1 will not only be prevented, but we expect tariff reductions,” said Zhumangarin.
      According to the Ministry of Economic Development, from Jan. 1, 2018, heat tariffs in the Aktobe region are expected to decrease by 10% (from 129.25 to 116.33 tenge / m²). At the same time, in connection with the approval of a compensating tariff for the service of Aktobe CHP JSC for the production of thermal energy, an additional 10% reduction in the heat tariff is expected from Feb. 1, 2019 (from 116.33 to 104.7 tenge / m²) . Thus, in general, in 2019, the heat tariff for the population in the Aktobe region is expected to decrease by 19% (from 129.25 to 104.7 tenge / m²).
      As of Dec. 20, 2018, the water tariff for the population in the Zhambyl region has been reduced by 22% (from 52.3 to 40.8 tenge / m³).
      In addition, from Jan. 1, 2019, tariffs are to decrease in the remaining 16 regions from 3% to 22.7%.
      To date, the public tariff for water disposal in the Zhambyl region is reduced by 0.4% (from 16.4 to 16.3 tenge / m³). At the same time, Zhumangarin noted that in the Zhambyl region it is one of the lowest tariffs in the country.
      In addition, from Jan. 1, 2019, tariffs are to decrease in the remaining 16 regions from 3% to 11.4% (from 54.07 to 47.91 tenge / m³).
      “As a result, the savings of the population as a whole for water supply and wastewater services will be more than 2 billion tenge,” said Zhumangarin.
      According to the Ministry of National Economy, from Jan. 1, 2019, the forecasted price reduction will be from 3.3% to 17.5%. At the same time, gas prices in Almaty will reduce by 12% (from 29.8 to 26.2 tenge / m³), in Shymkent and the Turkestan region — 6% (from 30.7 to 28.9 tenge / m³), in Zhambyl region — 6% (from 24.3 to 22.8 tenge / m³). As a result, the savings of public funds for gas supply services will be about 5 billion tenge.
      “Just yesterday, the Ministry of Energy published information on price reductions at the stations. Thanks to the work done, it became possible to reduce prices along the chain for final power supply services. Since the share of stations in retail electricity prices reaches 60%,” said Zhumangarin.
      The Ministry of National Economy has carried out the work to reduce electricity transmission tariffs. In addition, Zhumangarin noted that the tariff of KEGOK JSC, carrying out the transmission of electrical energy through the networks of the interregional level, within the limit of the five-year tariff, approved in 2015, was to grow from Jan. 1 by 12% (from 2.4 to 2.8 tenge / kWh). At the same time, the Committee on Regulation of Natural Monopolies, Protection of Competition and Consumer Rights of the Ministry of National Economy, together with KEGOC, made a decision to prevent the tariff growth and maintain it at the current level — 2.4 tg / kWh
      Thus, from Jan. 1, 2019, the decline in electricity prices in all regions of the Republic from Jan. 1, 2019, is expected. As of Dec. 20, 2018, electricity prices in  Zhambyl region have already decreased by 3.6% (from 13.35 to 12.86 tenge / kWh) and Kyzylorda — by 4% (from 14.51 to 13.93 tenge / kWh).
      The forecast decline in retail prices for the population will be from 1.7% to 22.32%. As a result, the savings of public funds for electricity supply services will be about 7.8 billion tenge.
      At the same time, retail prices of electric energy for legal entities in eight regions are expected to decrease from 1.7% to 18%, which, according to the vice minister, this will have a healthy effect for business.
      Savings of consumers for electricity services will be more than 14.5 billion tenge.
      “I want to note that the aforementioned reduction in tariffs will eventually lead to a reduction in the size of the average bill for public utilities (water, sewage, electricity, heat and gas) per month,” said Zhumangarin.
      So, for example, a reduction in the average check of a family of three living in a 2-room apartment of 60 m² will be following. In Almaty, on average, 14,483 tenge is paid a month for utilities. From Jan. 1, 2019, the total fee will average 13,128 tenge, or decrease by 1,353 tenge. Thus, the annual savings on utility bills will average about 9,700 tenge. In Astana, the average utility fee is 10,666 tenge per month. From Jan. 1, 2019, the fee will average 9,604 tenge or decrease by 1,062 tenge. Annual savings on utility bills will average about 9,000 tenge.
      “Today we state that based on the criticism that was addressed to us and our colleagues, certain conclusions have been made, the corresponding work with natural monopolies has been done, and from Jan. 1, 2019, throughout the country we expect a reduction in tariffs for water supply services, water disposal, power supply, heat supply and gas supply,” Zhumangarin summarized.
      In
      , the average utility fee is 13,788 tenge per month. From Jan. 1, 2019, the average fee will be 12,447 tenge or decrease by 1,340 tenge. The annual savings on utility bills will average about 10,000 tenge.

      Nov. 26 at the Government meeting chaired by the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, the draft Law “On Amendments to Some Legislative Acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Improving Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy Procedures” was approved.

      According to the Minister of Finance Alikhan Smailov, today about 4,000 business entities are undergoing the bankruptcy procedure, 400 enterprises are in the rehabilitation stage. The main directions of the draft law are the simplification of conditions for the application of rehabilitation and bankruptcy procedures, the reduction of the terms of procedures and the simplified liquidation of inactive debtors.
      According to Smailov, when applying the rehabilitation procedure, today the court should establish not only the fact of the payments termination, but also the fact that the debtor has the opportunity to restore solvency.
      “The bill proposes to facilitate this task: the court records the presence of unfulfilled obligations over three months and the fact of a ‘positive’ balance. This confirms the company's ability to restore its financial position. Similarly it works in bankruptcy,” said the minister.
      Thus, the draft law provides for the specification of the input criteria for opening the bankruptcy process. The court will need to establish the fact of a “negative” balance on the date of filing the application for declaring the debtor bankrupt, as evidence of the insolvency of the entity. Thus, according to Smailov, the bill eliminates uncertainty and simplifies entry into rehabilitation and bankruptcy procedures.
      In addition, it will be possible to rehabilitate individual entrepreneurs, who today can not apply the rehabilitation procedure and are forced to go bankrupt.
      “It is proposed to cancel all arrests on the debtor’s accounts and property since the court approved the rehabilitation plan. This will enable the company to proceed with the implementation of planned activities, without being distracted by litigation,” said Smailov.
      However, in order to prevent the use of rehabilitation by unscrupulous subjects, the draft law provides for restrictive measures. In particular, a ban has been established for the use of rehabilitation, if six months have not expired from the day the court decided to refuse to use such a procedure.
      In order to reduce the time of the bankruptcy procedure, the leading role in the procedures is assigned to creditors, since they are persons directly interested in the outcome of the process. Lenders exercise their powers through a meeting of creditors and a committee of creditors. However, the meeting of creditors is time-consuming and financial and involves the participation of all creditors, which can be dozens, and sometimes hundreds. On average, according to the Ministry of Finance, one bankrupt spends up to 7.5 months to convene all creditors' meetings
      “It is proposed to transfer a number of powers of the meeting of creditors to a more mobile committee of creditors. After this, a significant optimization of the terms of the bankruptcy procedure is expected,” said Smailov. The committee, in turn, is elected by the assembly, is its representative body, but it is small in number, and the procedure for its convocation is simpler.
      However, the bill requires creditors to file their claims for bankruptcy only within the expiration period.
      It should be noted that the current legislation provides for liability for intentional and false bankruptcy. However, for the further improvement the Ministry of Finance proposed to specify the corpus delicti of bankrupt officials as causing property damage to the legitimate rights and interests of creditors. That is, it will be sufficient to establish the fact that the official removed the property before bankruptcy and caused damage to the interests of the creditors.
      Changes are also provided to establish the responsibility of the actual beneficiaries of bankruptcy, that is, directly those persons as a result of whose actions the company went bankrupt.
      In addition, it is proposed to introduce a simplified procedure for bankruptcy of debtors without the involvement of the administrator. This will allow quickly and without unnecessary costs to eliminate debtors who actually ceased business.
      “It is expected that the proposed initiatives will allow a 32% increase in the use of rehabilitation and bankruptcy procedures by business entities, reduce the time to 25% and the cost of their implementation to 40%, which will positively affect Kazakhstan’s position on the ‘Insolvency Resolution’ indicator in the World Bank’s Doing Business ranking,” Smailov summarized.
      Chairman of the Board of Atameken NCE Ablay Myrzakhmetov noted that the amendments to the bill will have a positive impact on conducting bankruptcy and rehabilitation procedures. The National Chamber supports this bill and its amendments.
      Recall, the Head of State in September 2017 at the opening of the third session of the sixth convocation of Parliament noted the need to improve rehabilitation and bankruptcy procedures.

      The Head of State officially launched the Year of Youth "Tәuelsіzdіktіn Urpaktary." In an interview with PrimeMinister.kz, a PhD student of the Nazarbayev University School of Engineering Damira Pernebayeva and a metallurgist of the Aksu Ferroalloy Plant Alexander Shutov shared their thoughts on what they expect from the Year of Youth.

      PhD at the Nazarbayev University School of Engineering Damira Pernebayeva notes that, thanks to the support of the Head of State, a number of strong, talented young scientists appeared in our country. Young people go to science to give life to new discoveries and inventions. Speaking to the President at the official opening ceremony of the Year of Youth, Damira voiced the proposal of young people to establish special grants for the implementation of 100 promising and breakthrough researches by young scientists.
      “I’m sure that all investments will pay off in the next decade and give a powerful innovative impetus to the development of our state,” she said.
      The President supported this proposal and commissioned funding for advanced research by young scientists in the basic and applied sciences.
      “I believe that the allocated grants will allow to reveal the potential of young scientists, to create the basis for an early career in science. Such a step will be for us, young scientists of Kazakhstan, a real mechanism to apply our knowledge, talent and ideas for solving important problems for Kazakhstan,” D. Pernebayeva noted.
      As a metallurgist of the Aksu Ferroalloy Plant Alexander Shutov noted, the youth in production are creative people who daily generate a lot of ideas related not only to improvements in production, but also in the social sphere. These are projects for the collection and recycling of household waste, improvement of yards, construction of playgrounds with the use of environmentally friendly materials produced in Kazakhstan.
      Alexander himself came to the plant as a smelter, and now holds the position of master at the hot site. In addition to performing his work responsibilities, he takes an active part in the public life of the plant, participates in scientific and technical conferences and forums. At the same time, he is an activist of youth councils for scientific work and trade union youth of Pavlodar region.
      “Working at the stove has brought me love and respect for work, which I try to instill in my young colleagues. During my work, I witnessed fundamental changes in the enterprise, according to which the plant’s young people can judge about the changes taking place at the state level. The key role in everything is played by the policy of the Head of State, in which much attention is paid to the youth and its role in the future of our country,” said the metallurgist.
      In addition, Shutov is sure that all decisions aimed at supporting young Kazakhstanis made by the Head of State at the opening of the Year of Youth will soon give their results and have a positive impact not only on the economic, but also on the social development of our country.
      “I can say with confidence that all doors are now open for young people, and holding the Year of Youth will give an additional incentive to young people on their way to new challenges, and will expand their boundaries. All of this will certainly play perhaps even a key role on the way of Kazakhstan to 30 developed countries of the world, and we, the younger generation, should attach maximum efforts to this,” Shutov shared his opinion.

      During the discussion, Minister of Education and Science of Kazakhstan Erlan Sagadiyev said that a national databank of orphans and children left without parental care, and persons wishing to adopt children in foster their families was established in order to ensure transparency and accessibility in matters of adoption in April of this year.
      The latest figures confirm that more than six million children who are defined for adoption, custody, foster care through adaptation centers, returned to the blood family or defined in the institution for orphans and children left without parental care.
       "It is necessary to all concerned state agencies to intensify efforts to reduce the number of pupils of children's institutions for orphans through adoption, guardianship, foster care and foster care," summed up Deputy Prime Minister I. Tasmagambetov.
      In addition, upon completion of the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister had instructed the responsible structures, together with the Ombudsman for Children and non-governmental organizations to make proposals to improve the legislation, concerning the participation of non-governmental organizations in the placement of orphans and children left without parental care in Kazakh families.

      In October the Head of State in his Address “Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Incomes and Quality of Life,” instructed the Government to raise the minimum wage by 1.5 times from Jan. 1, 2019. In all regions of the country, company leaders began to increase the wages of their employees, thereby widely supporting the President’s initiative.

      Local oil enterprises of the Atyrau region have begun work to improve the financial stability of their employees as part of the tasks set in the President’s Address to the people of Kazakhstan. A number of companies have already increased their employees' salaries by an average of 10-30%.
      The workshop head at the Caspian Contractors Trust LLP M. Zharylgapov noted that he began his career as an average specialist more than 10 years ago. When the workshop has a lot of orders, he, counting allowances, receives up to 350 thousand tenge.
      “The position and salary increases every year. Before that, I earned 250 thousand tenge. After the President’s Address, the leadership raised the salary by 50 thousand tenge. The average salary of workers is 100-150 thousand tenge. Salary increase became a big support for the family,” Zharylgapov said.
      At this enterprise, 255 people produce metal structures — 2,000 tons in just one month. At the moment, the salary of 50% of employees has been increased. Most of them are working specialties. In the future, representatives of the company plan to bring this figure to 100%.
      According to the latest data, dozens of small and medium-sized enterprises have committed to raise wages from the new year, and economically strong companies, having become an example, are already showing concrete results.
      According to the Director of the Atameken Chamber of Entrepreneurs in the Atyrau region A. Idressov, at present, state bodies and organizations supporting small and medium-sized businesses are jointly carrying out explanatory work for employers.
      “We were at six oil enterprises of Atyrau region, where about 250-300 people work. Their salary increased by 10-30%. In addition, representatives of small and medium businesses are also trying to contribute to the implementation of the Head of State’s instructions, ”said Idressov.
      Large companies that support the Head of State’s policy intend to gradually increase the salaries of their employees. The working conditions, professional qualifications and experience of specialists will be taken into account. Since domestic entrepreneurs understand that only with a decent payment, a quality product will be produced.
      Recall, earlier the enterprises of the East Kazakhstan region said about the intention to increase the salary to their employees. From Jan. 1, 2019, the construction company Firma Asia LLC will increase the minimum wage to employees by 50%. Bakyrchik Mining Enterprise LLP is also considering the issue of increasing employee salaries.
      In the Almaty region, the decision to increase the minimum wage to employees was announced by Almaty Paint LLP, Abdi Ibrahim Global Farm LLP, Zharkent Starch Factory.
      In the Karaganda region, from October 2018, wages were increased by 34% to employees of the Mutlu Export LLP plant.

      At a briefing in the press center of the Government, Vice Minister of Internal Affairs Yury Ilyin spoke about the preventive measures being carried out for reducing the number of emergency situations.

      According to the vice minister, preventive measures taken by the Emergency Committee staff have prevented many tragic incidents. Ilyin notes that there is a decrease tendency in the number of accidents.
      In order to increase the efficiency of the emergency departments, a phased work is being carried out to equip it with material and technical means. As part of the Head of State’s instructions, it is planned to increase funding for the equipment of the emergency units. The Roadmap is being implemented, which implies an increase in material and technical base through the purchase of equipment, primarily fire and rescue equipment.
      “For several years, we plan to reach at least a nominal figure of 58%, taking into account equipment write-offs, which will allow us to respond more quickly to emergency situations,” the vice minister informed.
      At the same time, Ilyin pointed out another problem — the lack of a safety culture among the population.
      “The residents themselves are not always responsible for the recommendations given by our inspectors. There is no need for large forces, means and costs in order to cover up the chimney cracks with elementary clay sometimes, preventing the ingress of carbon monoxide. One should always proceed from the fact that education of safety issues, safety culture should be in every citizen. Proceeding from this, accordingly, there will be less tragic cases,” said the vice minister.
      Ilyin called on the residents of the country with recommendations for ensuring fire safety among the population.
      “The winter period is still going on here, a wave of cold snaps is expected, especially at night. More often, listen to our employees who go to raid events and try to protect your life with their recommendations,” the vice minister said.
      Also, Ilyin recommended citizens to purchase special devices to detect gas leaks.
      “I also recommend low-cost devices that now technically allow to detect carbon monoxide or natural gas leakage, purchase, install them in your apartments, residential buildings,” he said.

      To date, the first stage of the installation of cameras has come to the end. The city has installed and integrated 6335 cameras. Coverage of the whole city with Sergek cameras will be completed before June 1, 2018.
      Then the delegation got acquainted with the work of the Astana LRT office.

      In the President’s Address to the people, special attention is paid to issues of comfortable living, which primarily lies in the accessibility of housing itself. In the Government’s press center, Vice Minister of Industry and Infrastructure Development Kairbek Uskenbayev and Chairman of Housing Construction Savings Bank Lyazzat Ibragimova told about the criteria that participants of housing programs should meet and what should be done to get a mortgage.

      The Nurly Zher program provides the most favorable conditions in the country. First, one must have the citizenship of the Republic of Kazakhstan or the status of oralman, and second, during the last five years the depositor should not have had housing. Under the terms of the program, the cost of 1 m² of rental housing is fixed and amounts to 180,000 tenge in Astana, Almaty, Atyrau and Aktau. In other regions, the price does not exceed 140,000 tenge.
      Vice Minister of Industry and Infrastructure Development Kairbek Uskenbayev noted that the mortgage program 7-20-25 and the program Nurly Zher complement each other. Thus, the program 7-20-25 makes it possible to afford funds for the purchase of housing. Nurly Zher is aimed at providing the population with apartments at an affordable price.
      “Now all programs are aligned and complement each other. We have made changes to the program. If earlier under the Nurly Zher we only implemented housing for the contributors of the Housing Construction Bank, then this year we have the right to sell housing for the depositors of the 7-20-25 program and for depositors of the bank. Therefore, I think it will give a good additional incentive,” said the vice minister.
      Uskenbayev noted that the Nurly Zher provides a mechanism for returning and re-investing in housing construction.
      “Once money was invested, now this money on a returnable basis is constantly invested in the housing construction of our country. Every year, on the instructions of the Head of State, in connection with the adoption of the 7-20-25 program, the amount for connection of engineering communications was increased. If we planned 80 billion tenge annually, then from 2019 this sum was increased to 100 billion tenge,” he added.
      In turn, Chairman of the Board of Housing Construction Savings Bank JSC Lyazzat Ibragimova said that there should be no other credit burden for Kazakhstanis to obtain affordable mortgages.
      “Before applying to the bank for a mortgage, you will have to repay all your consumer loans, including credit cards at other banks. A very big problem is the availability of consumer loans among low-income groups of the population. There are statistics of the First Credit Bureau, that about 6 million people have consumer loans without collateral. These are loans for iPhones, home appliances and so on. Accordingly, these people need to pay off this debt in order to participate in various mortgage programs,” said the chairman of the bank.
      According to Ibragimova, the bank calculates the possibilities of each depositor, and provides available tools for repaying the loan.
      “Your average family income is taken, divided into each family member, income per family member is derived. We are looking to see if you can pay off this mortgage. According to the standards of all banks, after paying the mortgage, 50% of your income should remain so that you can live, take your children to school, dress them and eat accordingly. When we conducted this benchmark, we saw that we had the most loyal solvency assessment in our bank. We know that our category is first housing. Therefore, when we deduct the expenses, we take the lowest possible amounts, unlike other commercial banks,” she explained.
      As Ibragimova informed, today in Kazakhstan there is a very high demand just for mortgages due to the high birth rate.
      “About 420 thousand children are born in Kazakhstan, and each new child is, accordingly, a new room. We think that in the coming years there will be a lot of opportunities for the construction sector, and the opportunities that the state provides through Nurly Zher, 7-20-25, the bank system will allow getting them,” she noted.
      Along with this, to encourage and support depositors, the bank pays a yearly state premium, which increases every year. According to the law, the state award is charged on savings of 200 MCI.
      “Over 300 thousand people expect the state award, it will be more than 96 thousand. And in 2019, for the first time in the history of Kazakhstan, the state prize will “overstep” the amount of 100 thousand tenge. It will be 101 thousand tenge,” she said.
      Ibragimova assured that now the bank is in good financial condition. The bank’s assets as of Jan. 15, 2019, for the first time in the history of Kazakhstan, crossed the border at $1 trillion, this is the entire deposit portfolio plus the bank’s own capital.
      In 2019, the bank plans to credit its depositors under the Nurly Zher program for 59.7 billion tenge. Housing under the state program for clients of the bank will be implemented in all regions of the country. In 2019 according to regional akimats, it is planned to put into operation another 14,220 apartments.
      In addition, Kazakhstanis can learn about all the facilities under construction under the Nurly Zher program on the site baspana.kz. On the portal, the applicant for available square meters can choose the city in which he wants to buy an apartment, and see what is being built, whether applications are received, choose an apartment he likes, apply for participation in the pool of home buyers.
      It is worth noting that over the past 3 years the bank has focused on the huge automation of all business processes. Now it is possible to call a bank consultant to a house and replenish the deposit from any bank, regardless of the amount without fees.
      Today, the average age of the depositor is 36 years. About 150 thousand children's deposits from 0 to 18 years was opened. According to Ibragimova, people who once used the services of the bank understand the advantages and begin to save money from the birth of a child. Every third investor is between the ages of 18 and 29 years old.

      Press conference on the implementation of the New Social Measures of Elbasy “Aleumettik Qamqorlyq” announced at the XVIII Congress of the Nur Otan party was held in the Government’s press center. Government members represented by Deputy Prime Minister Gulshara Abdykalikova and the ministers of labor and social protection of the population, education and science, healthcare, and agriculture answered all questions from the media.

      Opening the press conference, Deputy Prime Minister Gulshara Abdykalikova said that the social block of the Government will have to carry out a large amount of work on the development of human capital, including identifying low-income families and providing them with timely state support.
      New social initiatives can be divided into large blocks: increasing income and support for low-income citizens, providing low-income families with housing, improving the quality of education and healthcare and developing the regions. In the next three years, 2.3 trillion tenge will be allocated from the budget for these purposes.
      According to the deputy prime minister, in this direction much attention will be paid to explanatory work.
      “A group consisting of the first heads of ministries and departments intend to visit all regions of the country,” said Abdykalikova.
      The reception of citizens, separate meetings on categories of the population will be held. For example, Minister of Education and Science Kulyash Shamshidinova will meet with representatives of education, teachers in villages. Minister of Healthcare Yelzhan Birtanov — with medical workers.
      “We will all meet with different categories of the population,” explained Abdykalikova.
      She also informed that during the visits, the work of the Public Service Centers and Employment Centers will be inspected.
      “More than 4 million families in Kazakhstan have different income levels. Of course, everyone wants support, but here it should be noted that assistance will be provided to the most in need. And other families will be considered individually. This is (first of all, measures of social support), providing jobs, providing loans for starting and continuing business, creating conditions for working at home,” explained Abdykalikova.
      Minister of Labor and Social Protection of the Population Berdibek Saparbayev spoke about measures to ensure a decent standard of living for citizens, including wage increases for low-income public sector employees, support for low-income families, and expanding employment promotion measures for large families.
      The question and answer session began with an explanation of support measures and state assistance to large families. In particular, the correspondent of Vremya newspaper asked Saparbayev to clarify the main criteria for the appointment of targeted social assistance and the conditions for its appointment.
      To begin with, the minister recalled that, on behalf of the President, assistance should be rendered, first of all, to the poorest families of Kazakhstan. To this end, it is planned to develop an individual social card for each family in order to be informed about the income and problems of families in need.
      The criterion for the provision of targeted social assistance by the state is the amount of income for each family member, which should not exceed 70% of the subsistence minimum. By the way, this criterion has been raised: from 50% to 70% of the subsistence minimum per person, that is, from 14,849 to 20,789 tenge in 2019.
      “When appointing social assistance, benefits to families with many children and mothers with many children awarded Kumіs Alqa and Altyn Alqa pendants, as well as disability benefits for children will be excluded from the total family income. Every month, for each child from a low-income family, guaranteed assistance of 70% of the subsistence minimum (20,789 tenge) will be paid. The size of the assistance for adult family members will be calculated as before,” explained Saparbayev.
      The minister also noted that this will allow an average increase in aid by 40%. These measures will cover more than 830 thousand people.
      Government support will also affect people who care for children with disabilities over 18 years of age.
      “Previously, this amount was 31,183 tenge, now it has been increased by almost 10 thousand tenge and is 41,578 tenge, this measure will cover at least 100 thousand Kazakhstani people,” he said.
      In addition, the procedure for assigning support will be simplified through the optimization of the requested documents. So, all the necessary documents will be requested through the information systems of state bodies. All that is required of citizens is an identity card.
      The correspondent of the Azattyq Radio addressed Saparbayev asking about the criteria for assigning the status of the “family with many children":
      “Can low-income families with three children, for example, expect social benefits, in general, if the family is low-income, but does not have many children, does it have the right to receive the assistance?” the journalist asked.
      Answering the question, the minister emphasized that a family has the right to be called large if it brings up four or more children, and all social benefits will depend solely on family income.
      Correspondents of Khabar 24 and Astana TV channels asked Saparbayev to clarify the conditions of the Enbek State Program for the Development of Productive Employment and Mass Entrepreneurship taking into account the needs of large families.
      According to Saparbayev, this issue is being worked out jointly with Atameken National Chamber of Entrepreneurs. It is planned to make corresponding changes that provide state grants of 505 thousand tenge to new families on a non-refundable basis.
      “In 2019 as part of the program, 5,000 microcredits are to be directed to the development of entrepreneurship among mothers with many children and persons with disabilities in the village. As a result, 15 thousand large families will have the opportunity to do their own business and increase income. Our main task is to provide Kazakhstanis who can work with jobs, it is necessary to employ them and create all conditions for them to earn money. For this we will work together with the Atameken so that they can open a business for themselves, can simultaneously raise their children and earn money,” said Saparbayev.
      Minister of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kulyash Shamshidinova spoke about the differentiated increase in wages by 30% to low-paid education workers.
      “These are mainly technical personnel of educational institutions and some categories of pedagogical workers: kindergarten teachers, assistant teachers, psychologists,” said the minister.
      A correspondent of 31
      Channel asked whether it was planned to make changes to the knowledge assessment system (return to the grading system) in schools and to conduct the Unified National Testing.
      Answering the question, Shamshidinova stressed that it is not just knowledge that should be evaluated. Today teachers should understand how much a student knows, understands, knows how to apply, analyze, summarize information and draw his own conclusions. The main task (facing the Kazakh education system) is that the student should have the opportunity to improve their assessment.
      She also assured that the agency will work to improve the content of UNT issues. Major changes in the testing are not planned.
      “We are not saying that today we will change something. The process is continuous — our children graduate from schools, they will pass the UNT, they should not be driven into a stressful state. There is a form, but we will work to improve the content of the questions, to evaluate what we have been teaching children for 11 years at school,” Shamshidinova explained.
      In turn, the Minister of Healthcare Yelzhan Birtanov informed about the wage increase by 30% to all nurses and junior medical staff, which is planned from July 1, 2019. The salary of doctors in the most demanded specialties will also increase. Thus, the salary of more than 225 thousand medical workers will be increased.
      Taking this opportunity, the moderator of the press conference voiced the question that had been received by the editors of the PrimeMinister.kz website regarding the work being done to increase the availability of medical services in rural areas.
      Birtanov answered that it is planned to construct primary health care facilities until 2021, most of which will be built in rural areas.
      “Our task is to ensure the availability of basic medical services that people use every day. This is primarily the services of clinics, services of district doctors, pediatricians, that is, primary care. To this end, we have worked with local executive bodies in 328 settlements, where there are worn out emergency first-aid posts and where there are no them — medical organizations, primary health care centers, outpatient clinics will be created, that is, the task is to provide the rural population with 100% access to primary health care in three years,” said Birtanov.
      The correspondent of 31
      Channel, in turn, asked the head of the Ministry of Healthcare about the work being carried out to create clinics on the first floors of residential buildings. According to the journalist, today there are many clinics in the country, but mostly they are private institutions and are not accessible to everyone.
      Birtanov, answering the question, noted that in order to make services in private clinics accessible, first of all, participation of private clinics in the provision of guaranteed free medical care and medical insurance in the future is necessary.
      “It is necessary that when a person receives services in private clinics, he does not pay, but the state pays for him. To do this, we involve private clinics in the provision of guaranteed healthcare. At present, 47% of the guaranteed services are provided by private clinics, that is, every second clinic that provides such services belongs to a private form of ownership,” said Birtanov.
      The minister also added that today there is a question of disaggregating clinics in order to create individual or group practices on the first floors of residential buildings.
      “Therefore, our task is to reduce the load by two times within three years. Encourage small forms so that people can receive medical services within walking distance,” the minister noted.
      The Minister of Agriculture Saparkhan Omarov, speaking about the development of the industry as a socially important institute that creates new jobs, noted that the State Program for the Development of the Agro-Industrial Complex was updated on behalf of the Head of State. The key tool of the program is anchor cooperation and the creation of a value chain. Now the state gives everyone the opportunity to create a family farm, become a member of the meat or dairy conveyor and receive a steady income.
      In addition, as part of the productive employment program, rural residents can receive microcredits for the implementation of business projects in the agro-industrial complex at a remuneration rate of not more than 6% per annum, with a term of up to 7 years.
      Continuing the theme of the press conference — execution of instructions of the Head of State, given at the XVIII Congress of the Nur Otan Party — the press conference moderator voiced a question to the PrimeMinister.kz audience related to the work on selecting promising villages for their modernization and infrastructure construction.
      As Deputy Prime Minister Gulshara Abdykalikova noted, within the framework of the special project “Aul-El Besigi,” it is planned to identify 1,500 localities, for the development of which 30 billion tenge will be allocated annually.
      The minister of agriculture said that, on the instructions of the President, the selection of promising villages is already underway. It will include many criteria such as job security, industry affiliation, etc.
      At the end of the press conference, the correspondents of the Almaty channel and KTK appealed to representatives of the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development, who were present in the hall, with a request to clarify the issue of providing rental housing to large families. Journalists were interested in the conditions of the program and the date of its launch.
      The Chairman of the Committee for Construction and Housing and Communal Services of the Ministry Markhabat Zhayymbetov said that there are 28 thousand large families in the queue for housing. For seven years, 6 thousand rental apartments will be built annually for large families. Thus, until 2025 more than 40 thousand rental apartments will be built.
      However, work on the issuance of housing will be coordinated with the actualization of the queues. So, large families will be placed in a separate queue, which will increase the efficiency of the work being done to address their housing issues.
      Zhayymbetov said that the rental housing program for low-income large families would be launched after the necessary changes were made to the regulatory legal acts in the second half of the year.
      “If an apartment costs 8 million tenge, 800 thousand can be reimbursed through a housing certificate. Two percent for 19 years: a pre-loan will be reimbursed for eight years, it is 42 thousand tenge a month, and then a two-percent housing loan for the next nine years is about 27 thousand. I think it is very affordable,” added Zhayymbetov.
      Recall that in his speech at the XVIII Regular Congress of the Nur Otan Party, President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized that the main priority of the country is ensuring a decent standard of living for citizens and the development of Kazakhstan as a socially-oriented state. In 2019, more than 45% of all expenses of the republican budget were allocated to the social sphere. Funds will also be allocated from the National Fund to improve the quality of life and the well-being of citizens. Based on the instructions of the President, the Government of Kazakhstan is actively working to strengthen measures to improve the well-being of Kazakh families, provide housing and modernize education and health care, and improve living conditions in the regions and villages.

      Dec. 4, 2018, at a press conference following a meeting of the Government, Markhabat Zhayymbetov, the chairman of the Committee for Construction, Housing and Communal Services of the Ministry for Investments and Development, spoke about the benefits of digitization in construction and public utilities sector.

      As Zhayymbetov noted, in the near future, the construction work register, the act of hidden works, the technical supervision, which are on paper today, will become unnecessary. The Ministry for Investments and Development has developed a single digital portal under the working title “Ui Qurylys.” This portal will record information from digging pits to taking objects into operation. All information will be stored in photo and video format. In addition, according to him, it will be possible to control the Kazakhstani content in construction: what materials are imported, what kind of production.
      “This will all ensure the transparency of the industry. We hope that there will be a very big reform. All parties involved: the customer, the contractor, the author, technical supervision, government agencies will be involved in this area. We will improve the quality of work in construction, and greater openness will appear in this area,” said Zhayymbetov.
      The chairmen also announced the creation of the e-SHANYRAQ information system, where the personal accounts of residents, natural monopolies, akimats and central executive bodies will be located.
      “All of us are residents of multi-storey housing, but we do not know what we are paying for. How much for the janitor, electrician, plumbing, etc. To ensure transparency in utilities, we created this application. Via smartphone you can vote, make decisions. For example, the elementary question of payment for the elevator. Through the online voting system, you can decide whether it should be card or monthly,” the committee chairman noted.
      In addition, Zhayymbetov reported on the benefits that the population will receive from the device. According to him, the basis of digitalization is full-fledged installation of devices.
      “When we install common house heat meters, we save 36%, and when automatic heat points are installed, we save up to 50-60%. For example, if a person pays 10 thousand tenge for heating, after the installation of these devices will pay 3-5 thousand tenge. On a national scale, we can save 32.5 billion tenge per year, over a period of 5 years — 162 billion tenge,” said Zhayymbetov.

All youth initiatives will receive real financial support from the state.

      Tourism is an important area of the country's economy, which can significantly contribute to the development and the creation of the international image of the state. Chairman of the Board of Kazakh Tourism JSC Rashid Kuzembayev told about the promotion of the tourist potential of Kazakhstan, both in the country and abroad.

      In 2018 on behalf of the Government, Kazakh Tourism started the development of the country’s tourism brand. He noted that the development of the brand and the adoption of the state program is a long process, it was decided to concentrate on working to increase the content of Kazakhstan tourism in the media and the Internet.
      “First of all, we began to actively increase the presence of Kazakhstan in social networks. In 2018 we organized the arrival of well-known bloggers from China, whose number of subscribers is more than 100 million. The bloggers visited tourist sites in Astana, Shchuchinsk-Borovoe resort area, Almaty and Almaty region, and also visited East Kazakhstan and Turkestan regions. Their publications today read by over 150 million Chinese readers, and their number is growing daily,” said Kuzembayev.
      The formation of the institute of ambassadors of tourism in Kazakhstan has also started: the first ambassador was the famous Kazakhstan singer Dimash Kudaibergen.
      “Taking into account his particular popularity among Chinese fans and music lovers from Southeast Asia and some European countries, we conducted a promo tour ‘Dimash Homeland’ with the participation of leaders of fan movements from 10 countries who visited 3 Kazakhstan cities. In total, these movements consist of more than 5 million people. We noticed a great interest of the singer’s fans. Soon in Kazakhstan, Dimash will hold two concerts where his fans are already gathering and as part of the ‘Dimash Homeland’ tour, tourists will be able to visit the cities of Kazakhstan, thereby contributing to the development of domestic tourism,” he said.
      According to Kuzembayev, well-known cosmonauts Talgat Musabayev, Anatoly Artsebarsky, Yuri Malenchenko and Yury Baturin will be the next ambassadors. In Soviet times, one of the stages of medical rehabilitation of cosmonauts after space flights took place on Lake Alakol. Therefore, they were invited to the resort area to renew this tradition.
      Along with digital marketing, traditional promotion is also underway. In 2018 Kazakh Tourism helped to ensure the participation of Kazakhstan's tourism business representatives in seven international exhibitions in Berlin, Moscow, Beijing, Hong Kong and a number of other cities was ensured.
      “We attracted active interest of visitors by showing our ethnic content. Kazakh batyrs are more than two meters tall, musicians, artisans, as well as souvenir sets of asyks were prepared. The ethnic content of the booth, including our batyrs, national cuisine workshops, national music and dance, created a special sensation,” said Kuzembayev.
      In addition, as part of the celebration of the capital’s 20th anniversary, expeditions were conducted along six routes covering almost all of Kazakhstan, as well as over 20 mountain peaks. The total coverage of the expedition was about 1.5 million people.

      Feb. 6 in the Government’s press center, Minister of Industry and Infrastructure Development Zhenis Kassymbek spoke about the development of housing construction, and also announced the key results of the implementation of the Nurly Zher State Program.

      Kassymbek reported that in 2018, the construction industry showed steady growth rates and amounted to 4.1% compared to 2017, labor productivity growth — 9%. Investments in residential construction increased by almost 8%.
      “It is indicative that 6-7 tons of private investment was attracted to 1 ton of public funds under the Nurly Zher State Program. A record 12.5 million m² of new housing was commissioned. This is above the level of 2017 by 12%. Entering housing per inhabitant in 2018 amounted to 0.68 m². This is the highest figure among the CIS countries. If you compare, for example, in Russia it is 0.54 m², in Belarus — 0.40 m², in Uzbekistan — 0.36 m². We are increasing the pace of housing construction,” said Kassymbek.
      According to him, more than 113 thousand families have improved their housing conditions, including more than 14 thousand families provided with rental and credit housing at the expense of state funds. On the introduction of housing in all regions there is a positive trend.
      Along with this, for the successful implementation of the 7-20-25 Program, funding for the construction of engineering communications has been increased to 100 billion tenge. For the execution of the order of the Head of State for the construction of at least 1 thousand rental apartments annually for working youth in the cities of Astana, Almaty and Shymkent, the mechanism and sources of financing have been determined.
      “In general, in 2019 we plan to build 13 million m² of new housing. Due to this, about 118 thousand families will be provided with housing. The main task is to bring the target indicator per person to 30 m² by 2030. Today this figure is 21.5 m²,” the minister noted.
      In addition, Kassymbek stressed that the issue of using domestic building materials was taken under special control.
      “If approximately 86% in housing construction is of domestic content today, we believe that within 3 years we will be able to raise this figure to 90%. This stimulates the production of building materials and will give an additional impetus to the construction industry as a whole. In late 2018, the share of Kazakh production in construction amounted to 77%, thereby exceeding the level of 2017 by 5%, including 86% in housing construction,” Kassymbek added.

      Youth is the healthiest part of the population, the vital force of society and the power of time, said Deputy Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Imangali Tasmagambetov during the plenary session within the National Youth Forum at Eurasian National University named after L.N.Gumilev.

      "Creating the conditions for education, professional, scientific and creative growth of young people is the most reliable investment in the progress and modernization of society. On behalf of the President of the country, all conditions for a constructive dialogue between youth and state are created for today. This meeting is an excellent opportunity to discuss topical issues, share knowledge, to better understand the opportunities and perspectives for closer interaction between youth and state, " Imangali Tasmagambetov said.
      Vice-Premier said that now is the time of short horizons, when knowledge must always precede action.
      "Knowledge is an exceptional factor. Speaking to you about the sign of equality between the quality education of Kazakhstanis and successful future of the country, the President called all the youth of the country not only to learn new skills, but to apply them to the benefit of the country," Imangali Tasmagambetov said.
      Deputy Prime Minister stressed that the only requirement for the youth is commitment.
      "Nothing and no one, even the most advanced education system and the most skillful teacher can not educate young people anything, if he does not have the main thing - the thirst for knowledge. Also, a very intelligent and knowledgeable young man will never make it, if he has no ambition and thirst for victory. Be aware that a successful person is the one who is constantly hungry for new knowledge, improves and goes further beyond the bounds of their own capabilities. Another option for the modern, more dynamic world is simply unacceptable," Imangali Tasmagambetov said.
      At the same time, deputy of the Prime Minister added that youth have huge intellectual potential and special abilities to be creative; youth is the most mobile part of society.

      The Head of State in the Address to the People of Kazakhstan “Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Incomes and Quality of Life,” “New Opportunities under the Fourth Industrial Revolution” announced specific orders for improving the social and economic welfare of the population, which entered into force today, Jan. 1, 2019.

       
      First of all, on behalf of the President of Kazakhstan, the minimum wage rises 1.5 times, the determination of its size will not be tied to the subsistence minimum. From 2019 the minimum wage will be 42,500 tenge. The increase directly affected 1 million 300 thousand people who work in all sectors of enterprises of various forms of ownership and covered 275 thousand employees of state-financed organizations, the salary increased by an average of 35%.
      According to the Ministry of National Economy, as a result of the increase in the minimum wage, the disposable income of more than 6 million employees will increase to 15 thousand tenge per year only due to an increase in the amount of income exempt from tax.
      Considering that the minimum wage of the employee retains the role of the minimum wage for more than 1 million Kazakhstanis (with a low wage level), wage growth will reach up to 50% from the 2018 level.
      All amendments adopted within the framework of the Law “On Amendments and Additions to Certain Legislative Acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Employment” are aimed primarily at improving the income and quality of life of every Kazakhstani person.
      In addition, according to the Ministry of Healthcare, to stimulate primary health care workers on behalf of the Head of State, wages are gradually increasing from today to 20% of local health workers who are introducing new approaches to managing diseases. So, from 2019, piecework payment is introduced for general practitioners and specialists with a gradual increase in tariffs for their services within the guaranteed volume of free medical care.
       
       
      In the Address “New Opportunities under the Fourth Industrial Revolution,” the Head of State is charged with enhancing the relationship between work experience and the size of payments in the mandatory social insurance system.
      In implementation of this order, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population developed a draft Law “On Compulsory Social Insurance” in a new edition. The changes are aimed primarily at giving better social protection to citizens in the occurrence of three types of social risks — in cases of disability, loss of the breadwinner and loss of work, through increasing the social benefits depending on the length of service participation in the compulsory social insurance system and changes in other parameters
      Thus, from Jan. 1, 2019, the size of social payments for cases of disability and loss of the breadwinner from the State Social Insurance Fund for all successful recipients increased by 5% in accordance with the level of indexation of similar payments from the republican budget. This concerns about 88.3 thousand recipients of social benefits in case of disability and 50.1 thousand recipients of social benefits who have lost their breadwinner.
      The average size of social benefits in case of disability increased from 15.9 thousand tenge to 16.6 thousand tenge, the average social benefit in case of loss of the breadwinner from 20.6 thousand tenge to 21.7 thousand tenge.
      Along with this, the draft law provides that for citizens with a long history of participation in the social insurance system, the coefficient used to calculate the size of social benefits will increase by 2% for each year over 5 years. For persons with disabilities, the size of social benefits in the event of disability is proposed to be determined on the basis of the actually established degree of disability (i.e. social benefits are personalized), rather than the average coefficient of disability.
      Families who have lost the breadwinner are invited to increase the coefficients of the number of dependents used to determine the size of social benefits in case of loss of the breadwinner. For persons who have lost their jobs, it is proposed to increase the income replacement ratio from 30% to 40% when determining the size of social benefits in case of unemployment, as well as to increase the duration of this social benefit from 4 to 6 months. In general, the proposed changes imply an increase in the size of social payments for cases of disability, loss of the breadwinner and loss of work by an average of 30%.
       
       
      According to the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population, today the solidarity pension has increased by 7%, the base pension — by 5%. Thus, the minimum joint pension from Jan. 1, 2019, is 36,108 tenge, the minimum base pension is 16,037 tenge.
      Therefpre, for men and women who retired before the introduction of mandatory pension contributions, the minimum pension from Jan. 1, 2019, is 52,145 tenge.
      At the same time, with an increase in the subsistence minimum, the minimum amount of pension payments from the Unified Accumulative Pension Fund has changed, equal to 54% of the subsistence minimum. The minimum amount of pension payments from the fund in 2019 is 16 037 tenge.
      By adding together the minimum solidary, basic and cumulative components, we get the minimum aggregate amount of pension payments equal to 68,182 tenge. From Jan. 1, 2019, citizens who are eligible to receive payments from the fund at the expense of mandatory pension contributions began to receive such a minimum pension.
       
       
      The Ministry of Labor and Social Support of the Population has also adopted amendments on the issue of payment of compulsory pension contributions for “freelancers” — individuals performing work or providing services under civil law contracts.
      Thus, the amendments are aimed at simplifying the procedure for the payment of compulsory pension contributions for "freelancers." It should be noted that these amendments take into account the opinion of the majority of representatives of this category of working citizens, the deputies and legal entities hiring freelancers.
      In the implementation of the adopted legislative amendments in the first quarter of 2019, changes will be made to the relevant laws. So, after approving the changes to the specified laws, freelancers will be exempted from obligations on payment of pension contributions from incomes under contracts of civil-law character.
      Individuals working under the agreements concluded with legal entities, individual entrepreneurs and private practitioners, who today act as tax agents who calculate and pay individual income tax for freelancers, will also pay an obligatory pension contribution for them . At the same time, individuals who work under the contracts concluded retain the right to participate in the accumulative pension system by paying for themselves.
      The next amendment concerning the participation of citizens in the accumulative pension system is the simplification of the procedure for opening an individual pension account in the Unified Accumulative Pension Fund for new contributors of mandatory pension contributions.
      If, in accordance with the current legislation, individuals need to personally contact the fund’s branches to open at the expense of the obligatory payments, in accordance with the current legislation, the new IAP mechanism will open the new depositors automatically for the new investors — on the basis of the first contribution to the fund.
      This mechanism for the “non-indicative” opening of an individual pension account at the expense of an obligatory payment will work from the introduction of changes to the Pension Rules of the Unified Accumulative Pension Fund, the adoption of which is expected in the first quarter of 2019. At the same time, all the necessary information about the details of the current document proving the identity of the contributor, about the place of permanent residence, etc., will be received by the fund from the information systems of state bodies.
       
       
      In accordance with the Address of the President, starting from 2019, an additional 30 billion tenge will be allocated annually to subsidize priority projects of entrepreneurs. Domestic enterprises will be asked to master a wide range of consumer goods, that is, to develop the so-called "economy of simple things." This is important not only for realizing the export potential, but also for saturating the domestic market with domestic goods.
      The participants in the first direction of the Program are entrepreneurs who implement and plan to implement their own and effective projects in rural areas, small towns and single-industry towns without industry restrictions. The participants of the second direction of the Program are effective entrepreneurs of industrial and innovation activity, implementing and planning to implement their own projects in priority sectors of the economy within the framework of the Business Road Map 2020, as well as in priority manufacturing industries and certain types of services identified by the State Program of Industrial-Innovative Development.
      In general, in 2018, funds for the implementation of financial and non-financial support under the Business Roadmap 2020 were allocated for 46 billion tenge. As of Dec. 1, 2018, 12,350 projects were subsidized by loans for 2,276.6 billion tenge, while the amount of subsidies paid amounted to 217.44 billion tenge, 4,668 were guaranteed for a total of 170 billion tenge, and the amount of guarantees provided was 70 billion tenge, state grants for 2,050 projects worth 4.6 billion tengewere provided. To provide the missing industrial infrastructure, 809 projects were financed for 122.5 billion tenge.
      An important direction of the roadmap is the strengthening of entrepreneurial potential, which includes a set of tools for teaching the basics of doing business and consulting support for potential and start-up entrepreneurs. As of Dec, 1, 2018, 173.9 thousand new and existing entrepreneurs attended training in the basics of entrepreneurship.
      An impetus to the development of entrepreneurship will also be given by a “tax amnesty,” under which penalties and fines from personal accounts of taxpayers as of Oct. 1, 2018 will be written off, subject to payment of arrears, existing as of October 1, 2018.
      Activities include an amnesty for small and medium-sized businesses in order to improve the business climate. Amnesty will be an effective mechanism to support entrepreneurs and will be an incentive for the payment of the principal debt and complete relief from the tax burden.
      According to preliminary data, the number of taxpayers subject to amnesty is 90,077. In case of payment of the principal debt for 210.7 billion tenge, the above taxpayers will be charged penalties for 122.9 billion tenge and fines for 7.3 billion tenge .
      In addition, from Jan. 1, 2019, the thresholds for criminal liability for tax violations were increased to 50 thousand MCI with an increase in fines.
       
       
      In his Address to the people of Kazakhstan Oct. 5, 2018, the Head of State announced the need to strengthen the fight against the shadow economy with a decrease of at least 40% over three years.
      In this regard, the Government approved a plan of measures to counter the shadow economy for 2019-2021.
      In general, the emphasis on business withdrawal from the “shadow” is based on the digitalization of tax and customs administration and their integration, including the implementation of initiatives under the project “Increasing tax collection.”
      According to the Ministry of Finance, the Action Plan is aimed at stimulating business and enhancing work on the withdrawal of small and medium-sized businesses from the “shadow,” increasing the share of non-cash turnovers, improving tax and customs policy, and legislation on public procurement.
      The measures taken will reduce the turnover in the shadow economy, increase tax revenues to the budget and will contribute to the country’s socio-economic development.

      Second annual forum “Digital Agenda in the Era of Globalization 2.0. Innovation Ecosystem of Eurasia” took place Feb. 1 in Almaty with the participation of prime ministers of the member states of the Eurasian Economic Union. Before the event, international experts told PrimeMinister.kz about the importance of developing digitalization and shared their own expectations from the forum.

      Consultant for the Transformation of Digital Economy, former Director General of the Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation Yasmin Mahmood notes that the innovation ecosystem goes global and now the task is to think about how the ecosystem leads to improved employment, how many Kazakhstani startups can position themselves in the regional arena respectively on the global.
      Director General of Tlabs, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Finance at Singularity University Amin Toufani also spoke about the benefits of digitalization for employment. According to him, many traditional professions lose their relevance — people should retrain, including in the direction of digitalization. Toufani notes that platforms such as Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba at the very beginning of their activities were underestimated, and now we see a completely different picture.
      “What did the online library facilities do? We say that the level of readiness of the respondents is much higher than before. Thus, an ecosystem is important, first of all, for a person; you need to take care and think what this ecosystem will bring to a particular person, a particular citizen. When we think about innovations, we need to think about how this very innovation will affect people,” said Toufani.
      Director of the Identification Systems Center of Belarus, a member of the Coordinating Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission Victor Dravitsa said that if the last forum was of a setup, then this forum determines the priorities of digital initiatives that were confirmed at the level of the countries and relevant EAEU bodies. The agenda at the level of heads of government includes consideration of the mechanisms for implementing these initiatives.
      “We will discuss the problems of forming concrete decisions on the digital agenda which was approved by the leadership of our countries at last year’s forum held in Almaty. Approaches and priorities are developed that need to be implemented first of all, and thus we will discuss the mechanisms for implementing these priorities on the agenda,” said Dravitsa, stressing that it is planned to create intercountry consortia based on a single technological platform or a single ecosystem for project implementation which will take into account country specificity.
      In addition, the expert noted that in the context of a single market for goods, it is necessary to create a single platform for small and medium businesses. In other words — the creation of a single catalog for enterprises with an indication of the goods they produce. The data will be available not only in domestic but also in foreign markets. Thus, an understanding of what products are produced in the countries of the Union will be reached.
      “We have open economies, so it is necessary to harmonize their product descriptions. Therefore, we need to adjust all the schemes for interaction in this plan and increase the information resource on the basis of which certain services will be provided,” explained Dravitsa.
      Speaking about the expected results of the implementation of a unified digital agenda of the EAEU, the expert noted that in this way small and medium-sized organizations without additional costs, without creating their own separate IT-environment will be able to fit into the international ecosystem and work on the principle of “business without borders.”

      At the Security Council’s meeting in November 2018 the Head of State instructed to complete a comprehensive work on reducing utility tariffs and improving the transparency of tariff setting system. In February 2019 the citizens received the updated utility receipts for January.

      In February Kazakhstanis received receipts for utilities at reduced tariffs, where prices are shown before and after reduction not only in traditional areas, but also for servicing the condominium. According to the Vice Minister Serik Zhumangarin, the difference was indicated in the receipts for the citizens to fully understand the tariff setting reform.
      “We did this so that people would feel that a real decline had occurred. Most of the population of Kazakhstan pays tariffs without even looking at the numbers. We reduced tariffs not only from Jan. 1, we lowered a number of tariffs from Nov. 1 last year. This is the work that we carried out jointly with the General Prosecutor's Office during the inspections, these are compensating tariffs that were introduced in relation to various subjects of natural monopolies,” said Zhumangarin.

According to official statistics, there are about 15 thousand followers of non-traditional religious movements. However, more than two NGOs (Astana, Kokshetau, Karaganda, Taraz) operate only in four regional centers, Petropavlovsk - none.

      On the eve of the heating season boilers of Kazakhstan production will be set up at Maylin and Kostanay stations in Kostanay region.

      "Hot water solid fuel boiler with afterburning long burning pyrolysis gases (TCD - 400 kW) is different from analog with high level of heat transfer and significantly lower emissions of harmful substances. High efficiency - not less than 90% is achieved due to the complete combustion," said Karim Tankebayev, the head of production and technical department of "Temirzholsu­-Kostanay" LLP.
      According to him, the use of boilers of this brand will improve the working conditions of railway employees. The operator will set the desired temperature and the boiler will continue to support it in the next 48 hours. These boilers are easy to use, practical, durable, resistant to wear.
       "They are different from their counterparts with operating cost efficiency. The cost of the coal is reduced by 30% compared to previous boilers and the same effect is obtained. This is particularly advantageous, as the cost of fuel and energy resources is growing," said K. Tankebayev.
      According to KTZ, it is planned to run the boilers of Kazakhstan production on the local rail facilities in October this year.

      The Prime Minister Karim Massimov has got acquainted with the current issues of development of the capital. He posted on his Instagram.

 

      "Actual problems of development of Astana: Road transport infrastructure, reconstruction of riverbed of Yesil, the work of treatment facilities, storm water drain, heating main, Detour on August 2, 2016,"  Prime Minister of the Republic of Kazakhstan wrote on his
      .
      The issue of development of road and transport infrastructure is one of the most pressing problem in the capital. There we have problematic issues such as increased fuel consumption by 1.3-1.5 times, and increased gas emissions by 2,5-3,5 times, moreover.
      K. Massimov began detouring the capital  from the area of ​​reconstruction of Kenesary street. To solve the above problems it is necessary to build road infrastructure,  15 streets and avenues, 6 bridges, 19 road junctions and overpasses, 12 interceptor parking garages.
      The Prime Minister also got acquainted with the progress of reconstruction of riverbed of Yesil River. The construction work must be completed in order to prevent the constant threat of flooding in urban areas.
      An acute problem in the capital is the question of treatment facilities, which worsened after heavy torrential rains in July. The capacity of the treatment plants didn’t protect from water  in a timely manner. Thus, a number of streets in the capital were flooded. Construction of sewage treatment plants will solve the problem, the work is scheduled for completion in 2018.
      Development of the storm sewer system will also prevent the streets of the capital from flooding. On the territory of Astana there are 10 storm water facilities, including 8  sewage disposal facilities.
      The city administration of Astana has developed an action plan for development of storm sewer system until 2019 with a phased implementation of projects related to the flooding of the territory of the international exhibition EXPO-2017 and the central streets of the right-bank part of the city.

      The forum "Future of Labor Market: New Opportunities" was held Nov. 29 in Astana with the participation of Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev. About 300 Kazakhstani and international experts, major employers, foreign investors and government representatives gathered at the event.

      The forum is organized to discuss the prospects for the development of employment and the social sphere in Kazakhstan in the context of dynamic changes in the global labor market under the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The issues of digitization of the labor market infrastructure and the transformation of the training system were actively discussed. The themes of labor mobility and the inflow of foreign talents, the development of an active employment policy on the path to inclusion, as well as new tools to support target groups were also raised.
      Opening the work of the plenary session, the Prime Minister noted that the ongoing transformation of the labor market and the associated challenges and opportunities are among the most pressing in Kazakhstan. This forum, in turn, will allow the exchange of views on the most important issues of labor market modernization.
      The full text of the Prime Minister Sagintayev’s speech is
      .
      During the plenary session, representatives of international organizations spoke about global trends bringing changes to labor markets. Experts with international experience informed about the impact of global trends for developed and developing economies. Experts from developed and developing countries, in turn, presented experiences and plans for managing changes in employment, education, and providing social protection measures.
      The plenary session was moderated by the Managing Director of BCG Sergei Parapechka, who noted that a balanced labor market, a high level of human capital’s development, productivity and employment are very important for most of the governments. Kazakhstan is no exception.
      “The President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev proposed and voiced the topic of Human Capital as the main for discussion in the Foreign Investors’ Council in 2019. Now this building has hosted an interim FIC meeting, at which human capital development was discussed. New human capital is the number one reform in the Strategic Development Plan of the country, prepared by the Government until 2025. The goal of our meeting today is twofold. The first is to discuss the challenges and prospects for the development of the labor market. The second is to discuss practical solutions that can be applied by states, employers and each of us in order to remain competitive in the labor market,” said Parapechka.
      Director for the Education Global Practice of the World Bank Keiko Miwa devoted her presentation to changes in the nature of work and voiced a number of recommendations on this matter.
      “Changes in the labor market greatly affect our countries. If you type “future work” in English in Google, you will find 2.6 billion results in a few seconds. This is indeed a very hot topic,” said the expert.
      According to her, there have been great discussions about robotics and artificial intelligence and how they will replace our traditional jobs. Due to automation, many jobs in the traditional sectors will disappear. But nevertheless, innovation allows the creation of new jobs. In general, they will increase, but they require stronger social and emotional skills. Now, as the expert noted, routine cognitive skills are no longer required.
      “Technology companies are changing very quickly. Technologies emerge and they change the way people work. The conditions in which they work are less long-term – they are increasingly short-term, part-time, remote, through online platforms. But in the aggregate, their number is insignificant – only 3% of the world labor resources. But trends are increasing. What can the government do with these changes? We focused on three major investments: investing in human capital, stimulating learning throughout life. In addition, due to the changing nature of labor, a stronger social protection system is needed,” said Miwa.
      OECD Directorate of Labor and Social Affairs, Head for Non-Member Countries Alessandro Golio, in turn, focused on changes in the labor world and their impact on labor markets.
      “In many countries we are returning to the unemployment rate before the global crisis and even lower. But at the same time, we see a big difference between countries within this dynamics. There is a growing gap in productivity levels between different types of firms. Adaptation to technological change is going on at an uneven pace: some companies find it harder to ensure it. We observe a polarization of the labor market. This means that middle-level skills are declining, and employment with the highest and lowest skills increases. That is, those jobs that are routine are subject to the greatest influence,” said Golio.
      Deputy director general of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department of the Asian Development Bank, Kiara Bronki, spoke about technology policy, jobs and the labor market.
      “I last visited Kazakhstan 10 years ago. After 10 years, it is very pleasant to see even greater dynamics, energy and proactive thinking of an open country. These aspects are very important in order to capture the potential of technological progress on a global scale. Technologies lead to the emergence of new professions, these are not routine cognitive skills. Now there is a shift of low-skilled workers by highly skilled,” said Kiara Bronki.
      PwC partner Michael Ahern reported on the practical preparation of workers for the future. In particular, the expert presented the results of recent PwC research in collaboration with the London Business School in the area of ​​work environment forecasts for 2030 and the skills, competencies and gaps that exist between today's competencies and those that will be needed in the future.
      “At a time when we are all talking about technology, artificial intelligence, big data, it is surprising that the working environment is still an important factor for us. We are all human. We want to work in an environment where there is a balanced life, where the workload is reasonable, where there are opportunities for development. This fact should not be overlooked. That is, human feelings are still paid a big focus. But at the same time, we now have access to data that did not exist before. Therefore, we, as employers, should take advantage of these benefits,” said Ahern.
      Partner in People Advisory Services at EY Singapore Samir Bedi spoke about future skills and best international practices, as well as how the Government of Singapore handles this.
      “In 2018, we celebrate the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Kazakhstan and Singapore. There are certain similarities and differences between our countries. A key similarity is our enthusiasm for the new labor market, the ability to redesign skills. For Singapore, the labor market is the whole world and our people are our main asset. It is very important for us to be competitive and have the necessary skills of our people. For the last 3-5 years, we have been trying to find the answer to the question: “How to prepare the workforce to meet the new demands of the labor market,” Bedi said.
      The presentation by Deputy Managing Director for Human Resources of Chevron’s Eurasian Division Diana Gilliz was devoted to digitalization and the evolution of the workforce.
      “Digital technologies have become a reality that change our lives, the image of our work, leisure, and the key word here is ‘change.’ Changes have become the norm for both individuals and the entire company. Chevron believes that the digital revolution will be a great opportunity to improve business. We have already been working in Kazakhstan for 25 years and are partners with the Kazakh Government.
      How do we use digital technology in our work? For example, we have millions of kilometers of roads for driving, and we are now using technology to increase driver safety. In cases where drivers suddenly fall asleep and are distracted on the road, the system notifies the driver and monitors its activities in the long term, and we can make our own changes. We use automation tools, such as drones, that we can use to stop equipment. We must always be a learning company, lifelong learning is the key to success. We use visualization technologies at our fields, where employees will be given instructions from the office and the supervisor will see how well employees are working. The basic concept is lifelong development. Leadership is also one of the priorities, we must be convinced that leaders create the right conditions for their employees, it is important to manage the workload and keep a balance between work and personal life,” said Gilliz.
      Having heard the foreign experts, Sagintayev noted that the measures taken by the Government of Kazakhstan to form the labor market coincide with those suggestions of international company representatives. In addition, the Prime Minister invited foreign experts more often to come to Kazakhstan in order to know what he is doing, how Kazakhstan is developing and where it is going to understand the joint work.
      The forum also summed up the first stage of the project “Development of labor skills and job incentives,” implemented by the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population with the support of the World Bank. The participants discussed the impact of modern technologies on the demand for various work skills in the international and local context, the role of education in shaping the necessary skills and competencies in the 21st century, and also noted the importance of developing the National Qualifications System for improving and shaping the balance in the Kazakhstani labor market.
      The forum included four thematic sessions on the topics “Technologies, Skills and People,” “Large Employers: New Challenges,” “Inclusive Employment and Employee Support Measures,” “Skills and Jobs,” at which forum delegates evaluated the scenarios of the impact of challenges on the global labor market to national markets, new forms of employment and the adaptation of the social protection system.

      The volume of use of qualitative seeds of wheat and fertilizers has doubled in Kazakhstan. This was reported by the Vice-Minister of Agriculture Toleutai Rakhimbekov at a press conference in the press center of the Government.

      According to the speaker, since wheat is the main export commodity, in crop production within the framework of the new State Program of the Agro-Industrial Complex Development, measures are envisaged to expand the areas of sowing with qualitative seeds and increase the application of fertilizers. 
      "We planned that by 2021 we will increase the area of crops with qualitative seeds twofold, from 3 to 6%, and applying fertilizers about 1.5 times from 10-11% to 16%. It must be said that the support mechanisms established within the framework of the State Program worked. In the current year, the area of sowing with qualitative seeds has doubled, and the volume of fertilizers used has increased from 10 to 14%, it means that there is little to do until the target indicators are reached" – T. Rakhimbekov said. 
      The Vice-Minister also said that agricultural producers began to buy more fertilizers - if last year 265 thousand tons of fertilizers were purchased, then 407 thousand tons were purchased in the current year. 
      "That is an increase of two times, this was facilitated by changes in subsidy mechanisms for the acquisition of fertilizers" - he stressed.

Chairman of the Board of Kazakh Tourism JSC Rashid Kuzembayev told about the work being done to develop Kazakhstan's tourism in an exclusive interview with PrimeMinister.kz.

      In 2018 the inbound tourism grew by 10% and domestic tourism — by 5%. As the chairman noted, this growth was achieved even against the background of a high tourism rates of 2017.
      According to preliminary data for 2018, 8,488.3 thousand people visited Kazakhstan, which is 10.2% more compared to 2017, and an increase of 32% compared to 2015.
      The tourists come primarily from such countries as the UAE (50%), India (49%), Malaysia (44%), Hong Kong (22%), Poland (16%), South Korea (15%) and the US (5.8%). At the same time, the flows of visits by citizens of Germany, Great Britain and a number of other countries remained at the same level.
      The Head of State in his Address to the people of Kazakhstan dated Oct. 5, 2018, “Growing Welfare of the Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Incomes and Quality of Life,” ordered to create a separate sectoral government program for the development of tourism.
      According to Kuzembayev, the development of the program is at the finishing stage and the program will be ready within the next 3-4 months. In addition, a bill on tourism has been developed, which is also being coordinated and will be submitted to the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan within six months.
      “The state program consists of six main directions for the formation and promotion of tourist destinations. In the draft state program, we reflected the main provisions of the strategy for promoting the tourism brand of Kazakhstan. The adoption of this document will enable the systematic promotion of Kazakhstan as a new tourist destination on the world tourism map. The national company, Kazakh Tourism, will become a country brand manager who will receive the appropriate resources and authority. At the same time, we believe that the process of advancement should involve all interested parties, such as the ministries of culture and sports, foreign affairs, information and communications, local executive bodies, Atameken National Chamber of Entrepreneurs, business and the public. Thus, we will create a real basis, a strong foundation for the effective and sustainable development of tourism in Kazakhstan,” said Kuzembayev.
      He noted that the core of the target audience are Millennials (Generation Y), as well as representatives of Generation Z, who today form the trends of tourism and travel. Given this, the promotion is mainly focused on digital channels.
      “The promotion strategy consists of three stages. At the first stage, the national tourism brand and sub-brands will be actively promoted with a focus on the first two groups of target countries. On the second — the focus will be on advertising key tourist products. And the third stage involves active work with promising markets and the expansion of target countries,” Kuzembayev noted.
      In addition, to increase the effectiveness of marketing communications, the focus will be on promoting the TOP priority tourist areas designated by the Head of State: Almaty Mountain Cluster, Astana, Shchuchinsk-Borovoe resort area, Turkestan, Alakol, Mangystau, Bayanaul, Balkhash and Shalkar-Imantau resort area.
      It is worth noting that in 2018 the Ministry of Culture and Sports, together with JSC Kazakh Tourism National Company and regional akimats, selected the most significant tourist sites and formed the Touristization Map of Kazakhstan, which included 60 objects and destinations. The selection criteria were the uniqueness of the object as a tourist attraction and the potential growth of tourist flow. Their historical and cultural significance was also taken into account. Among these objects, TOP-10 of the republican scale were prioritized, which will ensure an increase in tourist traffic and the contribution of tourism to the economy.

      Forum “Digital Agenda in the Era of Globalization 2.0. Eurasia Innovation Ecosystems” gathered more than 800 international experts, representatives of the EEC, UN, EAEU countries and embassies Feb. 1 in Almaty. Astana Hub Consultant Joseph Ziegler answered the questions of Primeminister.kz about the forum, the main trends in the digital development and the role of technology parks in the innovation ecosystem.

      “I am very excited about the work that the Kazakhstan’s Government is doing in terms of introducing digital technologies. The digitization of the Government, namely the provision of state services in electronic format was about 60% in 2018, this year it is planned to increase this figure to 80%. This is an amazing figure for a fairly short period. Kazakhstan clearly shows a dynamic transformation. I think that Kazakhstan’s experience in digitalization can be applied in other countries. States can confidently adopt the reforms that Kazakhstan has been successfully implementing,” said the expert.
      According to Ziegler, Kazakhstan should not slow down the development of the digital direction. It is necessary to continue to improve the issue of stimulating young scientists, to give them the opportunity to realize their skills and knowledge, to launch as many unique startups as possible. You also need to focus on creating a universal platform to attract investors and mentors, so that they can assess all the opportunities to work in Kazakhstan.
      Today Astana Hub, as the speaker notes, has a decent base of young scientists who want success and achievements in the information environment, as well as compete with other scientists from different countries.
      Ziegler reported that Astana Hub International Technopark did a great job during the year of its activity: 47 different projects were implemented with more than a thousand participants involved.
      The expert also highlighted the unique feature of Astana Hub, which distinguishes it from other international technology parks.
      “I would like to draw attention to one fact that I have not met either in Singapore or Australia — a progressive taxation regime was proposed, which allows minimizing risks and making this object more attractive for investors and startups. This is the toolkit that helps us to become as competitive as possible, and these tax regimes make the situation even better,” he said.
      As the expert noted, 2018 was very successful for the technopark. In 2019, everything has to be done to make Astana Hub a driving force in the forefront of the development of digital technologies in the country.
      “We need to teach people how to invest in a digital environment. Our task is to involve outside participants in this process and do everything possible to expand the base of our clients. Our idea is to combine technology parks and make sure that they cooperate as much as possible not only with in-country parks, but also parks that are located in the regions,” said Ziegler.
      Also, the task of Astana Hub is to create an innovation ecosystem: what can be done faster and better than others?
      “We need to clearly understand that we must be ahead. We need to be more competitive. We need to provide access to technology so that citizens of different categories, including people with disabilities, feel comfortable,” he added.

To simplify obtaining state support to exporters, the export.gov.kz portal has been updated, where every entrepreneur will be able to receive services related to the promotion of exports, as well as submit an application for participation in trade and economic missions. In addition, the portal is planned to integrate with leading marketplaces, dispatchers of logistics services, electronic customs declaration system.

Public discussion of amendments to the Constitution of Kazakhstan will continue until February 26, 2017.

      The main essence of the constitutional reform, announced by the Head of State in a special appeal on January 25 this year, is the transfer of the powers of the President of Kazakhstan to the Government and Parliament.
      The Cabinet of Ministers will be given more powers in the economic sphere, and the main issues of defense capabilities, external policy, governance, protection of the Constitution and to ensure the effective work between branches of government will remain in the competence of the President.

      The President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev in his address on the redistribution of powers between branches of government stressed that the process would be a logical and consistent step in the country's development.
      "It is important to strengthen the role of Parliament in the formation of the Government to enhance the responsibility of the Cabinet before the deputies. The party that won the parliamentary elections will be a decisive influence on the formation of the Government," the President of Kazakhstan said.
      According to the Head of State, one of the five institutional reform means more open work of the Government.
      Thus, the right to develop the main directions of socio-economic policy of the state, its defense capability, security, guarantees of public order and organize their implementation transferred to the Government of Kazakhstan.
      The Government will approve the national programs and ensure their implementation with the President’s agreement.

      With the President’s agreement to approve a unified financing system of workers’ pay for all bodies, financed by the state budget.
      To report to the President of the Majilis of the Parliament about the main directions of the Government's activity and all of its important decisions.
      The Government shall resign its powers to the newly elected Majilis.
      It should be noted that all of this together will increase the responsibility of the executive government agencies and their managers, and give the necessary powers.
      The Working Group on the redistribution of powers between branches of government was established by order of the President of Kazakhstan.
      As a result of discussions, the Working Group produced 40 proposals for redistribution of powers of the Head of State, which can be transferred to the Government and some of the executive bodies.
      "The Working Group was proposed a set of amendments aimed at redistribution of organizational and legal powers of the Head of State in the economy, budget planning and business activities, which may pass into the competence of the Government. The functions on the formation of the list of objects are not to be transferred for the purposes of public-private partnership, the definition of the priority sectors of the economy in order to stimulate them, the statement about the award of honorary degrees to business entities engaged in entrepreneurial activities and made a significant contribution to the development of charity, as well as on formation of Republican budget commission and approval of its regulations and composition, the definition of the state planning system and some others," commented Minister of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan Marat Beketayev.

For example, the creation of state-owned enterprises; definition of the person from whom the goods was purchased, works and services performed outside the public procurement procedures; approval of the list of holiday dates and model regulations of the public authority and the other," added the head of the Ministry of Justice.
      A range of responsibilities of the head of state, according to the Working Group, may be referred to the competence of the Government in coordination with the Presidential Administration. This is due to the preservation of the functions of the Head of State to determine the main priorities in foreign and domestic policy, national security and the country's defense.
      It is important to note that such a large-scale revision of the features focuses on the issue to increase the responsibility of the Government and its members individually. Thus, a new reality is formed; the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan will work in its terms. This is a logical continuation of state policy formation and development of competitive national economy, certain special appeal of the head of state Nursultan Nazarbayev.

      On the margins of the event, First Vice Minister for Investments and Development Roman Sklyar spoke about the importance of holding such competitions. He noted that in the conditions of the new industrial revolution, it is especially necessary to study not only one specialty, but also related professions, as well as skills to work with the latest technologies.
      “Certainly, working professions in Kazakhstan are in demand more than ever. As the Head of State noted, citing as an example his own experience when he began his labor activity as a metallurgist and reached great heights, he became the First President and became the creator of a new state. He showed it on his example. The youth perceives this very positively and the imperative of time is such that it is necessary to master several specialties. It is not necessary now, as in past years, to say that one specialty is needed for the whole life. Of course, in some cases, this is justified, but young people now need to acquire new specialties and learn throughout their lives, comprehend new elements of their profession and possibly related. We see now that new specialties are needed in industry: digitalization is developing, and industrial enterprises, agricultural enterprises, and other transport and logistics complexes give new promises to new professions. There is room for young people to strive for and, of course, such a competition provides an incentive for those who have not decided on their future profession,” said Sklyar.
      The organizers, participants and experts, in turn, told PrimeMinister.kz reporters about the level at which the competition was held, and noted the importance of such championships for improving the quality of training.
      An expert, a teacher at the Karaganda Transport and Technology College Akbar Tashen noted that in the competence “Cars” the contestants compiled a change-speed gearbox. According to him, it is very difficult. However, the participants are prepared, fluent in modern technology.
      “The holding of this championship is a very necessary and important matter, which must be continued. Teaching young people and improving their skills is a big deal. Over the four years of the championship in Kazakhstan, tremendous work has been done. We have achieved high results, but there is still something to work on, as they say, you need to hone your skills. It is necessary to learn from the experience of other countries in Asia and Europe,” said Tashen.
      The technical delegate from Almaty, Kuatbek Abildinov, spoke about how the organizational part of the competition was built. He stressed that the Kazakhstan championship was held at the level of European standards.
      “In this competition, we were engaged in technical organization: compliance with the procedure, the work of experts, work on the site. From our point of view, the championship was held at a very high level. If we take in comparison with the European Championship in Budapest, then our championship was held at about the same level. Requirements for the participants were made according to international standards. The program also corresponded to the European Championships and the World Championships held in Abu Dhabi. Part of the tasks was similar to the tasks of the CIS championship. In the practice of world championships, it rarely happened that the tasks on technical competencies were completely fulfilled. So they are complex. I was surprised when in our championship many participants completed their tasks fully. I think the psychological training of the participants that they were given in the regions played a big role here. Another moment that surprised me at the championship, the participants support each other, they do not see competitors or rivals in others. They communicate, share experience, suggest,” shared Abildinov.
      The judge, technical delegate from the Turkestan region, Aidos Appazov, stressed that the level of vocational education in Kazakhstan is on the rise.

      “The WorldSkills Kazakhstan project is designed to raise the image of vocational education in Kazakhstan. For the fourth year we observe how students from colleges from all over Kazakhstan manifest themselves at this site. This provides an opportunity to participate in future international competitions. I tried two competencies: mechatronics and electrical installation. There were a lot of participants in the ‘Wiring’ competence and it was a little difficult for us to judge. In addition, in the wiring there are a lot of small details and trifles, on which the operation of the device depends. But our guys managed. In the competence ‘Mechatronics,’ participants had to create a whole station, working through a computer device. It was very interesting. The level of vocational education is rising, the equipment is already up-to-date, the guys are prepared according to international standards,” said Appazov.
      Nurzhan Syzdykov, an expert and teacher at the Kentau Polytechnic College in specialist disciplines, emphasized the importance of the support provided by the state for students in technical specialties. According to the teacher, young people feel it.
      “It gives much responsibility when preparing students for such modules as wiring, electronics and robotics, because it is necessary to instill in students knowledge in accordance with the requirements of the world standard. We try to adhere to international standards. At present, the level of students rises significantly, and at the end of the training they become true masters of their craft. WorldSkills Kazakhstan is the highest level of testing their knowledge for students, and probably for us it is also an assessment, because when we teach, we learn together with them. We have a dual system of education, more than 60% of students do internships at factories and industrial enterprises, and accordingly, significantly improve their skills. Our students, starting from the 3rd course, already have jobs. Today we can say with confidence that the status of engineering specialties has risen much higher and most of the students prefer such professions, because the people feel demand, relevance, state support, and wages have become significantly higher,” said Syzdykov
      Ilya Chuprynin, a silver medalist in the competence in “IT Solutions for Business,” told about how the championship was held and what tasks were given to the participants.
      “As part of the competition, we made an airport, created a full automation of the airport, that is, we needed to receive users, orders, reports for the flight attendants and how much resources would be spent on each flight. We also made additional services and mobile application for booking flights. Projects can be applied, but they will need to be refined. We had six assignments for three hours. We worked at speed. We were 10 people working in a programming language. Now students can safely go to study in this profession because the government has changed the program. We have moved away from the old standards and are learning new subjects more deeply and efficiently. I like it very much,” Chuprynin informed.
      Another participant in the competence “IT Solutions for Business,” a second year student at the Industrial Pedagogical College of Kostanay, Artem Kosarenko, indicated that the competition's tasks met the latest market needs, which made the championship even more useful in terms of staff training.
      “Now I am getting a specialty in computer engineering and software. Our task at the competition was to fulfill the order of an imaginary customer, the customer was the company, the airline, we needed to automate the process of flight, departures, buying tickets. Technicians and programmers will always be in demand in the 21st century, in the century of new technologies,” Kosarenko supported his colleague.
      Temirkhan Orynov, a winner in the specialty “Turning Works on Machine Tools,” spoke about the importance of training, including at such sites.
      “I chose this specialty because it is very much in demand in our time. With these skills, you can find a job you like, moreover, I like that now everything is moving into an automated format, which makes work much easier. Such specialties are very necessary and I believe that it is right to support young people in the choice of working professions. In the future, this will have a positive effect on the development of the country,” Orynov shared his opinion.
      A participant from Zhambyl region, Talgat Makhambetov, spoke about participation in the “Cargo Body Repair” competence and noted the prospects for the development of this working specialty in Kazakhstan.
      “There are almost 30 types of professions and 350 participants. My profession is related to the automotive industry. We had seven participants from seven regions. Today there is no such a specialty, but it is vital and very necessary. The profession is called “Cargo Body Painting,” it began to get used only in recent years. Previously, nobody knew about such a profession, I would be very happy if this profession would have found a response from students, because there are practically no specialists on the market. You can say the market is free and open, especially since there are all the conditions to develop and even start a business,” said Makhambetov.
      Aelita Amangossova, the gold medal winner in the Bakery, said that within the framework of the contest 14 people from different regions of Kazakhstan were preparing different dishes for 3 days, including bread products and more sophisticated dough preparation techniques.
      The prize-winner, the winner of the gold medal on the competence "Design and Modeling of Clothes," Arai Muslim-bi also shared her impressions of the competition.
      “I study at the Fashion and Design College in Almaty in the competence of 'Fashion Designer.' We were 14 participants and absolutely everyone was worthy of winning. During the competition it was necessary to sew a dress, but it had to be with technological and design difficulties. This profession in Kazakhstan is very necessary, our country needs to enter the international market, because for this there are all the necessary conditions. You just need to want very much and learn. It is not difficult at all,” Muslim-bi noted.
      Another participant of the “Design and Modeling of Clothes” competence championship, Zhanayim Maksut, indicated that WorldSkills Kazakhstan opens up new opportunities for young people.
      “I really like my profession, from childhood I loved to sew. In the first module, we drew sketches; in the second, we sewed dresses; in the third module, we did draperies. It is so great that Kazakhstani youth can receive such professions that are really necessary and in demand for free. I am very pleased to take part in this project. WorldSkills really opens up new opportunities for young people,” said Maksut.
      One of the participants, Anuar Sarbassov, who arrived from Semey, noted that the championship allows to study world service standards and improve the quality of their own skills, which directly increases the chances of the labor market.
      “At the moment, the restaurant service in Kazakhstan is developing and is already quite in demand... In the future I plan to open my own place. We had a lot of modules, the main ones are the waiter, barista and barman. I demonstrated all these skills. I took part in European service skills, WorldSkills standards, world standards. We are taught everything. I have been preparing for 2 years,” said Sarbassov.
      It should be noted that the creation of a site with 30 different equipped sectors also took place thanks to the support of the existing business. Head of the Knauf Training Center Oleg Sotnikov said that the company has provided expert, technical support and since 2016 has been the official supplier of the WorldSkills Kazakhstan project. It also provides materials for the championship.
      “The first stage was the introduction of a new specialty in dry construction. Active work is carried out with educational institutions. On the basis of educational institutions of Kazakhstan, the company has established resource centers — in Astana, Almaty, Kostanay. Work is also underway with all educational institutions that are willing to acquire new knowledge and technology. Our company has been actively participating in the championship from the very beginning, since 2015. In 2018, we see that the level of participants is much higher. Schools receive the necessary knowledge and competencies and can already perform more adequately. I hope that next year in Kazan we will be in the top three,” noted Sotnikov.
      Director of the training unit of the German company FEST Group in Central Asia, Stanislav Kuskov, in turn, told what prospects open to the participants of the championship. The company has been actively cooperating with the association WorldSkills Kazakhstan on the competence of Mechatronic for the past three years.
      “First of all, we work with industrial enterprises, such companies as KAZ Minerals, Kazzinc, Kazakhmys, in the field of automation. We understand that qualified specialists at enterprises need exactly international class and in this case, being a sponsor of competitions, we provide both equipment and the help of a leading expert with international certification. We are taking mechatronic workers to the staff, today we are looking at the professionals. But we are preparing these specialists for the industry. We are preparing children, first of all, a great potential of work in these companies opens up for them. Tomorrow they will come to the enterprises and these will be international experts,” said Kuskov.

      During the press conference following the meeting of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Vice Minister of Culture and Sports Askar Batalov spoke about the goals and tools for implementing the updated Concept for the development of the tourism industry of the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2023. 

      According to A. Batalov, in connection with the entry of tourism into the Olympic circuit, the industry faces an important task - to increase the share of tourism in the GDP structure to 8% by 2025 and to ensure 100% growth of inbound tourism to the country. 
      "As a rule, 95% of tour operators are focused only on outbound tourism. It is necessary that tour operators, together with authorized bodies, determine for themselves Kazakhstan as a place where it is necessary to attract both domestic and incoming tourists. With this in mind, the previous version of the Concept for the development of the tourism industry has been updated," A. Batalov said. 
      The main tool for the implementation of the Concept will be the Action Plan. Within the project management, specific indicators are indicated, according to which the labor productivity will increase annually to 4-5%, the employment of the population - by 5%. This, according to A. Batalov, will increase the share of tourism in the structure of the economy of Kazakhstan.

Participants shared country experiences on building a modern digital economy. It is noted that innovation allows countries to be more competitive, adapted to change and help ensure a higher standard of living. So, it is innovations that today create a solid foundation for the development of entrepreneurship, business growth and the creation of new jobs, as well as helping to solve problems in the field of health, environment, energy and food security.
      Bakytzhan Sagintayev in his speech noted that the main goal of all innovations and technologies is to improve the lives of people, to create comfortable conditions for their work and growth.

At the same time, work is underway to further attract strong players in the innovation sphere. All the necessary conditions have been created for combining talents and developing competition for the participants of Astana Hub: this is the simplification of the visa and employment regimes, the provision of rental housing, tools for grant financing. In addition, it was noted that the development of competition within the EAEU will improve the quality of start-up projects.

      Minister of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan Bakhyt Sultanov during the press conference on the results of the Government meeting reported on the main principles of the bill being developed to improve the sphere of public procurement.

      The main principles of the new bill on improving the sphere of public procurement are the creation of uniform rules for all subjects of the quasi-public sector and increasing the responsibility of the participants in procurement. According to B. Sultanov, a single approach will facilitate the terms of participation in procurement of the state and quasi-public sectors for entrepreneurs. At the same time, it is planned to unite all the information systems that exist today in the public procurement system.
      "Today, unfortunately, there is no responsibility at us for purchases in quasi-public sector in the legislation. Therefore, the amendments to the Administrative Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan and anti-corruption legislation provide liability for violation of the procurement rules of the quasi-public sector," B. Sultanov noted.
      The bill also provides for the control of the quasi-public sector by the Internal Audit Committee of the Ministry of Finance. As the Minister of Finance stressed, this measure was adopted in order to coordinate the corporate governance system in the quasi-public sector and develop uniform procurement rules.

      Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Karim Massimov posted on Twitter a video in which the head of Tesla Motors Elon Musk talks about development prospects of virtual reality.

      "Years ago we had "Ping Pong"- two rectangles and a dot. That is where we were. Now 40 years later we have photorealistic, 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it is getting better every year. And soon we will have virtual reality, we will have augmented reality.
      If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality.
      Since games to become indistinguishable from reality, and could be played on any set-top box or on a computer, and considering there would probably be billions of such computers or set-top boxes, the chance we would be in base reality seems to be one in a billion. And what is wrong with that argument?
      In turn, K.Massimov said that humanity will experience changes in the future. For example, development of a solar market and changes in automobile industry.
      "Cars  will become different. Now we see that one country after another decides to refuse from diesel cars and transfer to cars on batteries. That is going to happen, and then what to do, how to make decisions on oil refineries, development of our traditional automobile industry? It seems it is so far, but 10-15 years will pass very quickly and we as a Government together with you have to find answers to these questions," K.Massimov said at the III Congress of "Atameken" National Chamber of Entrepreneurs of Kazakhstan  in June this year.

      The Ministry of Healthcare of the Republic of Kazakhstan is developing measures to prevent the promotion of certain names of medicinal products. This was stated at the press conference following the meeting of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan by the head of the department Yelzhan Birtanov.

      The patient decides to purchase a medication by appointment of a doctor who prescribes preparations of certain brands. Pharmaceutical companies put the cost of such a "promotion" in the cost of drugs. The Ministry of Healthcare of the Republic of Kazakhstan intends to take this situation for special control.
      Y. Birtanov noted that this problem is relevant for the whole world. However, key pharmaceutical companies began to sign internal regulations on the refusal of unethical promotion of medicines, including in Kazakhstan.
      "Nevertheless, everything cannot be controlled. The market is large, a lot of distributors work. We intend to legislatively fix the responsibility of medical workers for unethical promotion of medicines," the Minister said.
      First of all, this measure will affect the employees of pharmacies, since prescription drugs can only be prescribed by doctors. In addition, medicines must be prescribed by an international non-proprietary name without trade names. The patient must choose the name and manufacturer.

      Kazakhstan Global Investment Forum 2018 was held October 2 in London (United Kingdom). Over 150 business representatives took part in the event. The Kazakh delegation was led by the Deputy Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Askar Zhumagaliyev.

       
      The forum was devoted to new opportunities in the field of business and investment, as well as the prospects of Kazakh-British projects in the fastest growing sectors of the economy of Kazakhstan. The main topics discussed included current innovations in improving the country's investment climate and tax and customs benefits, the State Property Privatization Program, the favorable geographical position of Kazakhstan at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, its participation in the Chinese initiative “One Belt, One Way,” the Eurasian Economic Union, and the functioning of the AIFC which applies the norms of English law on its territory.
      Among participants there were more than 150 senior executives from the manufacturing, agricultural, chemical, mining and financial sectors, as well as metallurgy, alternative energy, logistics and digital technologies, including representatives of such large international corporations as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, JP Morgan Bank, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Ernst &amp; Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the London Stock Exchange and many others.
      Deputy Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Askar Zhumagaliyev, AIFC Governor Kairat Kelimbetov, Vice Minister for Investments and Development Arystan Kabikenov and Chairman of the Board of Kazakh Invest Saparbek Tuyakbaev spoke at the opening of the forum.
      “Kazakhstan is interested in attracting British investors who will bring with them finance, technology and best business practices necessary for successful diversification of our economy and its integration into the global system,” Zhumagaliyev noted in his speech at the forum. The UK is one of the largest investors in the economy of Kazakhstan. It accounts for $13 billion out of the $300 billion raised over 27 years of independence.
      The Governor of the Astana International Financial Center Kairat Kelimbetov devoted his presentation to opportunities opening up for investors, taking into account the work of the AIFC. Thus, the AIFC provides its members with a special tax regime up to 50 years, guarantees an independent system of dispute resolution based on English common law. The official presentation took place in July 2018.
      “The launch of the Astana International Financial Centre this year is also transforming Astana into a regional financial centre that will promote your business further to the new horizons,” Kelimbetov summed up his address to the forum participants.
      The Vice Minister for Investments and Development Arystan Kabikenov spoke about the development of investment climate. Today, Kazakhstan holds 36th position across 190 countries in the World Bank's Doing Business 2018 ranking. That’s number 1 in "Protecting Minority Investors”, and number 6 in "Enforcing Contracts.” At the same time, the work continues. Thus, by 2050 Kazakhstan must join the world’s 30 most developed countries. To ensure further economic growth, the Government continues to pursue a policy of attracting investment. In 2017, together with the World Bank, we developed and adopted the National Investment Strategy in which we identified top priority sectors for attracting investments. Mining and metallurgy are amongst the most important sectors of the economy, forming more than 21% of exports. Overall, Kazakhstan ranks the world’s 6th for natural resources, and 10th for total volume of minerals (excluding oil and gas). There is also a great potential in the fields of exploration and development of copper, gold, phosphates, and rare earth metals production, including lithium and vanadium. Investments into geological exploration, and the development of new technologies for processing raw materials are of special interest.
      “This year we have adopted a new subsoil use code based on the ‘first come – first served’ principle. It also facilitates free access to geological information and will shorten the time for granting subsoil use rights for solid minerals from 18 months to just 10 days,” Kabikenov said.
      In his turn, the Chairman of the Board of Kazakh Invest Saparbek Tuyakbaev informed the participants that the company identified and prepared 70 niche projects in priority sectors of the economy — agriculture, chemistry and petrochemistry, mining and metallurgy, mechanical engineering and metallurgical engineering, tourism, and energy.
      “From establishing links with local companies to supporting project maintenance and coordination, we provide a wide range of services to facilitate investment, acting as a ‘one-stop shop’ for all investment queries and needs. Kazakh Invest serves as a single point of contact, representing the Government during discussions of proposals and conditions for investment projects in Kazakhstan,” Tuyakbaev said.
      The company has a wide range of representatives throughout the world who in close cooperation with the Embassies ensure information and timely responses. This makes it easier for investors to learn potential for business growth and market expansion in the region. There are local representatives in the regions of Kazakhstan, who in fact serve as the Advisors to Akims (Mayors). They make sure the investors have smooth operations and all the questions and needs are addressed fully. Besides, the company streamlines all the interaction with the state bodies and local authorities when the investors need to register business, obtain permits, licences or any other public services. It also includes state support for investors such as investment contract, registration as a member of the Special economic zones, application for innovation grants and so on.

      “The interests of the UK are not limited to the mining industry of Kazakhstan, the privatization program and the development of Astana as a Eurasian financial hub. We also want to participate in the diversification of your economy,” the British Trade Envoy Baroness Emma Nicholson stressed speaking at the plenary session.
      In his turn, the Head of the EBRD Suma Chakrabarti noted that Kazakhstan has the necessary potential to become a vivid example for other countries seeking to build a sustainable market economy that works in the interests of the whole society and is open to the rest of the world.
      The outcome of the forum was the conclusion of a number of agreements with British companies in the fields of transport and logistics, metallurgy, energy, agriculture, engineering, and in the field of developing the healthcare system infrastructure. The Samruk-Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund and the EBRD signed an agreement on the provision of a guarantee to the loan agreement between ShalkiyaZinc LTD and the EBRD. The Fund has acted as a guarantor of obligations for financing the construction of a concentrator at the Shalkiya deposit in the Kyzylorda region.

      Nurly Zhol State Program of Infrastructure Development is one of the key drivers of the national economy. This is not only the emergence of modern highways, but also the growth of the country's GDP, new jobs, an increase in transit traffic flows. At the same time, the main emphasis was put on the construction of modern and high-quality motorways. The implementation results of the Nurly Zhol in 2018 are presented in the review material by PrimeMinister.kz.

      The goal of the state program is to integrate the country's macroregions by building an efficient infrastructure. The program envisages the construction and reconstruction of more than 7 thousand kilometers of republican roads and the repair of more than 10 thousand kilometers.
      According to the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development, in 2018, within the framework of this program, 24 projects for the construction and reconstruction of highways of republican significance with a total length of 4.6 thousand km were carried out.

      ldWithin the framework of Nurly Zhol, it is planned to buid 6.5 thousand km of toll roads by 2020.
       
       
      The state program is aimed at creating a single economic market of Kazakhstan through the formation of macro-regions of the country with the definition of the cities of Astana, Almaty, Aktobe, Shymkent, Ust-Kamenogorsk as a hub city of national and international level with modern infrastructure the system. We note the program’s several main projects.
      So, according to the Kandyagash – Makat project in 2018, work was carried out at four sites. Twenty-four km of the lower covering layer was completed.
      According to the Zhetybai – Zhanaozen project, work was carried out at two sites. As a result, 17 km of the upper coating layer was laid and 81 km of the lower coating layer was arranged in one direction.
      As part of the Western Europe – Western China project, a tunnel is being built in the Turkestan region. Works on concreting the tunnel 445 m (left 340 m and right 105 m) and drilling 780 m (left 350 m and right 430 m) were completed.
      Also in 2018, work on the procurement of building materials and the roadbed was carried out on the Kurty – Burybaytal site.
      In the Uzynagash – Otar project, preparatory work has begun on two sites.
      In August 2018, the Kuryk port launched a car ferry terminal, built during the second phase of the port development.
      The capacity of the ferry terminal today is more than 2 million tons. The ferry terminal has the ability to handle two ferries simultaneously. The terminal contains checkpoints and inspection of vehicles with a radiation monitoring system, passenger checkpoints. The water area of ​​the port from the west and east is enclosed by protective hydraulic structures. Navigation support for navigation of vessels in the port water area and at the approaches to it is provided by the vessel traffic control system. A car access road was built to the port, which made it possible to connect it to the republican road network.
      The port has organized the procedure for processing cargo documents on the principle of "one window" and provided a preliminary exchange of information with the port of Baku; on average, it takes no more than four hours to process one ferry. By the end of 2019, the ministry plans to complete the automation of production processes and integrate the port information system with the Nomad control system.
      According to the ministry, for the 11 months of 2018, 4.5 million tons were handled through the seaport of Aktau, which is 25% higher than the same period in 2017. At the same time, through the three new dry cargo terminals of the port of Aktau from the beginning of their operation until Dec. 1, 2018, 2.7 million tons of cargo were handled.
      Also in 2016, the construction of the railway ferry terminal of the port of Kuryk with a capacity of 4 million tons was completed and in 2018 the automobile ferry terminal, built as part of the second phase of the development of the port of Kuryk, was launched. Since the start of operation of the Kuryk ferry complex, about 3 million tons of cargo or more than 43 thousand cars and 2 thousand wheeled vehicles have been transshipped.
      In general, the implementation of the above projects has increased the capacity of the seaports of Aktau and Kuryk to 26 million tons.
      Activities planned to implement under the Nurly Zhol State Program by 2020:
       
       
      Today, most of the objects of housing and communal services are used with an excess of service life. Basically, it is a network of heat, water and wastewater.
      In order to carry out an accelerated modernization of housing and public utilities, budget crediting and subsidies are provided for under the Nurly Zhol State Program.
      The main indicators in the implementation of measures for the modernization of housing and public utilities is to reduce the wear of the networks of heat and water supply, water disposal from 65% in 2015 to 57% by 2020 and to improve the quality of services provided to consumers.
      Thus, the plan is to build and reconstruct 3,478.6 km of heat, water and wastewater networks, 29 boiler houses and 95 other objects.
      In general, during the implementation of the program from 2015 to 2018, 2,982 km of heat, water supply and drainage networks, 24 boiler houses, 71 units were built and reconstructed. As a result of the measures taken, the wear of networks from 2015 decreased from 65% to 57%.
       
       
      Implementation of projects in the field of water transport, including the construction of three new dry cargo terminals in the port of Aktau, the construction of a ferry complex in the port of Kuryk, the acquisition of 2 dry cargo vessels and the purchase of 6 units of vessels of the state technical fleet, created about 450 new jobs.
      Over the years of the program, more than 100,000 jobs have been created in the field of road projects. In the direction of modernization of the systems of heat, water supply and sanitation for the period from 2015-2018, 7640 temporary and 472 permanent jobs were created.

      Major international organizations have confirmed the high level of Kazakhstan's statistics. This was stated at a press conference in the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan by the Chairman of the Committee on Statistics of the Ministry of National Economy Nurbolat Aidapkelov.

      Reliability of statistical information has always been an urgent issue. There is a so-called "global assessment" in statistical practice. The Kazakhstan statistics for all time of the existence passed such estimation three times - in 2003, 2008 and 2016.

      "At the end of 2016 and early 2017, we were assessed by three major international organizations - the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Eurostat and the Free Trade Association. As a result, they recorded significant progress in Kazakhstan's statistics, giving us the leading role in the Central Asian region, and encouraging to share the experience on methodology" - said Nurbolat Aidapkelov.

      In general, about 5,000 indicators form the statistics. Reports in online mode and on hard copies are received by the Committee on Statistics of the Ministry of National Economy, where specialists analyze the information received and, if necessary, crosscheck it for reliability.

      At the opening of the Year of Youth, the Head of State instructed to elaborate a roadmap for the development of youth and family. Vice Minister of Social Development Zhuldyz Omarbekova told about the ongoing work in this direction in an interview for the PrimeMinister.kz official site.

      The Roadmap for the Year of Youth is aimed at creating conditions for the realization and development of the potential of young people, increasing their level of competitiveness in all spheres of public life. The draft Roadmap consists of activities in four areas: affordable and quality education, availability of work, housing and the ability to start a family.
      “The Head of State explained very well about the structure of the Roadmap at the opening of the Year of Youth. These are four issues that have always been worrying and, probably, in the future, youth will always be worried about: education, employment, housing, as well as support for a young family. These four questions that the President instructed us to pay attention to in creating the Roadmap. A lot of measures in this direction were envisaged by the Government,” said the vice minister.
      Also Omarbekova called on all youth representatives in 2019 to take an active part in the development of the country.
      “At the forum, the Head of State said that we brought up a good generation of young people — patriotic, loving. Our youth is very educated. Many of them graduated from different universities in the world. We, as the Ministry of Social Development, urge all young people in the Year of Youth to make their contribution to the development of the country. We are launching the campaign ‘My Contribution to the Year of Youth for the Development of our Country.” The most important thing is to study well, to try to work, to contribute to the economy of Kazakhstan. For those who want to work — there is work. For those who want to learn, all conditions are also created. Kazakhstan is a country of great opportunities,” noted Omarbekova.

      Kazakhstan solves the problem of changing the development model. Head of competitive international research center "Astana" Anuar Buranbayev believes that to achieve these goals, it is important to change the model of development, based on sales, on a more stable and balanced. How does this affect the country's economy and whether our society will change in the near future? The expert answered the questions in an interview with Primeminister.kz.

      According to him, the global trend gaining strength of mass introduction of cyber physical systems in manufacturing and business processes, called succinct word "Industry 4.0", will have a serious impact on all aspects of society. However, the modernization of the economy is not possible without the modernization of society and state institutions.
      A.Buranbayev believes that the President's Address to the Nation "Third Modernization of Kazakhstan: global competitiveness" offered timely corrections of tactical and medium-term goals and objectives of Strategy "Kazakhstan-2050". At the same goal - to enter 30 most competitive countries of the world, adjustments in accordance with the current reality were proposed. Since announcement of  "Kazakhstan-2050" Strategy in December 2012, there have been significant changes both in the external environment and the internal state of the country.
      According to the expert, three key external factors create the very "new reality." The first is the completion of the commodity super cycle and access to the zone of the stabilization of commodity prices at lower levels. A.Buranbayev believes that we should not expect a sharp rise of commodity prices in the medium term. The second is the change in the geopolitical situation related to regionalization and increasing conflict. The third is the development of two strong integration projects EEC and "One belt one way." The internal agenda has just changed. The Government sharply reduced ability to support the growth.
      Not all of society positively perceives the proposed ideas. In this regard, the expert offers to look back and remember a time when Strategy "Kazakhstan-2030" was declared in 1997. According to him, the people had also disbelief. However, thanks to the correct use of the opportunities, the main objective of Strategy "Kazakhstan-2030," the construction of a sovereign state, has been implemented. Quality of life is incomparable to the mid 90-ies of the last century. But a large part of society has a sense of injustice associated with the negative aspects of rapid growth based on the raw material model: the uneven distribution of incomes and rising inequality, the growth of state apparatus and corruption, the difference in the development of territories and access to public services.
      A.Buranbayev noted that it is important for Kazakhstan to gradually move from a resource model to a more sustainable development based on a better balance between economic sectors.
      "In the Message, in my opinion, three important things are highlighted. They are modernization of economy, society and state institutions. This is the threefold challenge and all three areas should pass in order to achieve the goal of modernization of society. Modernization of economy and technological upgrading will be impossible without the modernization of society. The modernization of society and the economy will inevitably lead to demands for modernization of state institutions, " says the expert.
      Regarding the technological modernization, the expert highlights several important trends, which, in his opinion, will change the model of production of goods and services.
      It is worth noting that the main targets of the influence of "Industry 4.0" in Kazakhstan will be the company's raw materials sector. According to the expert, digitalization will have a significant impact on the infrastructure monopolies, public service delivery and business models.
      "Firstly, the raw materials companies in Kazakhstan will be forced to introduce modern technologies; they will not be able to achieve performance ensuring global competitiveness without it. The consequence of this is the release of a significant amount of the labor force, it will have a significant impact on the stability of single-industry towns and encourage internal migration," A.Buranbayev said.
      Secondly, the use of new technologies will make the process of public services more transparent, which will reduce corrupt rents.
      Third, the use of modern technology will allow infrastructure companies to dramatically increase the efficiency of the services.
      Fourth, the digital technology stimulates a change in consumer behavior and will affect the change in business models. Joint consumption of Economics (Uber, AirBNB, Carsharing and so on), re-use economy (when resources are re-circulation), e-commerce (Amazon, Alibaba, etc.) and associated digital platforms open up new opportunities for entrepreneurship. In addition, the total digitalization of society lead to a change in the production model.
      "Previously, the issue of social stability and employment often prevailed over economic efficiency, obstructed the reduction of people in every way. Now, we come to a common consensus: if our companies, including those in the mining sector, want to survive, they need to change the model of production," A.Buranbayev said.
      Reducing of labor creates the following problems: "What to do with the liberated labor," "What to do with the single-industry towns are subjected to the negative impact."
      In this regard, according to the expert, sharp acceleration of the urbanization process in Kazakhstan and the emergence of problems "false urbanization" is possible.
      A.Buranbayev considers that it is important to use this trend for the development of the country. It is necessary to take into account the model of the "core-periphery" in promoting the country's development. The most complex economic activities are concentrated in the economic centers of density, which is the largest city and metropolitan area.
      "There is an exponential decline in economic difficulty and the investment attractiveness of the territory as we move from the core to the periphery. From this perspective, it is important for Kazakhstan to create two centers of the hubs of professional services and knowledge-intensive sectors, and large regional agglomerations - manufacturing centers," A.Buranbayev said.
      It is in the center, according to him, are prerequisites for the creation and development of clusters and knowledge spillover. In addition, large cities generate demand, which allows you to successfully develop micro and small businesses, which are major sources of job creation.
      The expert notes that Kazakhstan should take steps in order to make the complexity of the economy.
      "In my opinion, Kazakhstan has good chances in two types of manufacturing industries “regional processing" and "global innovation for the local markets." Regional processing is the development of food processing, chemical, petrochemical industries and construction materials, and examples of the use of global innovation for local markets related to the engineering industry," A.Buranbayev said.
      The most striking example of global innovation to local markets is automotive. Using one platform, a model, which takes into account peculiarities of consumer preferences and conditions, is produced for each country. In Kazakhstan it would be the production of attachments for power machines to be adapted to our soils.
      "But at the same time, we must not forget that it is important for the country to start exporting processed products. Food products, petrochemicals, and in a subsequent and complex engineering products can create export potential. This will further complicate the economy,"  A.Buranbayev said.
      According to him, basically, our exports are on the periphery of the space products and technological complexity is very simple. What we need to strive to complication of the economy. This will make the economy more resilient and competitive, said A.Buranbaev.
      "The same model "center- periphery "shows that the most developed agriculture is close to major cities. The farther away from the city, the more it’s easier, less complicated, less developed," A.Buranbayev said.
      Agriculture can be a driver only if sufficient economic difficulty. As an example, the expert cited such countries as the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Argentina, New Zealand. These countries are the leaders in the export of agricultural products. In this case, it is - a country with a very high economic complexity and a high degree of urbanization. We have the same stereotype that if you reduce the rural population, the agricultural sector will be no one to deal with. The expert recommends to move away from this stereotype.
      Nevertheless, the expert is of the opinion that Kazakhstan needs to develop a strong city, and to strive for the emergence and development of global cities.
      "We have little strong cities. The notion of "global city" is the trend in the shift of economic power to them. There is only one city in Kazakhstan; Almaty is included in the Beta group. In general, large cities, and especially global, promote the development of human and social capital," A.Buranbayev said.
      By social capital, in his words, the positive effects that occur when people communicate with each other are understood. Social capital creates the effect of the overflow of knowledge. A.Buranbayev believes that Kazakhstan along with the support of its citizens' initiative should involve initiative people from other countries. He noted that Kazakhstan is on the 52 place on the last rating of talent attractiveness. In this ranking, our country is a leader in Central and South Asia.
      "Whether we can use it or not depends on us, on whether our society is ready to accept strangers. It should be noted that the United States, Canada, Europe strongly attracted foreign nationals. Any developed country has a program for attracting talent," A.Buranbayev said.
      He argues that we should not resist coming to the Kazakh market of foreign talent. After all, if a foreign citizen to come to our country and will start any business or scientific activities, the people of Kazakhstan will only benefit from this: there will be new jobs will be created knowledge will be a contribution to the country's economy.
      One of the most important tasks of social modernization is a departure from the paternalistic model.
      "We still have the majority of people believe that the government will solve all of them. The state should ensure their income, work to clean up the entrances, courtyards and so on,"  A.Buranbayev said.
      He believes that it is necessary to deviate from this pattern of behavior, and actively involved in the development of the country. We will achieve the objectives of the third modernization of Kazakhstan only by joint efforts.

      During the meeting of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Karim Massimov  serious shortcomings were revealed in the work of local government offices on cattle cemetery. This was reported by Vice-Minister of Agriculture Gulmira Isayeva.

      According to her, 702 burial points in Kazakhstan do not have the necessary barriers or markings.
      "For example, in Pavlodar region there are  86 points,  in West Kazakhstan region – 84,”  the deputy minister confirmed.
       Issayeva has also confirmed that the governorates are obliged to carry out work on burials.
      "For this purpose,  the republic requires 1.6 billion tenge, and only 22% of the required amount has been allocated over the past two years,"  Issayeva noted.
      Vice Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture has criticized the quality of cattle cemetery in the country. So, she said, the inspection held in June has revealed that  the majority of cattle cemetery has no barriers.
      "In Karaganda and Akmola regions there are no fences and markings. In NKR there is animal burial with identification marks, but they are made of a wooden structure, but concrete sarcophagus is needed, " she noted.
      In total, according to the data in the country there are 3298 burial grounds, 2546 of which with a primitive structure.
      Requirements to the burial grounds are defined by veterinary and sanitary rules. As the vice-minister, a typical cattle cemetery should be fenced.
      "77% of the burial grounds do not meet the requirements of the country,"   she concluded.
      Last week at a meeting of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan Karim Massimov instructed the Ministry of Agriculture to strengthen the veterinary control, as well as to deal with the protection of burial grounds.

However, there is a different issue, it is, “how will we teach children with disabilities who want to receive the appropriate education?” Vice Minister noted.
      The problem lies not only in the absence of ramps in schools, he said, it is necessary to carry out large-scale work in different areas.

      The Vice Minister drew attention to the fact that it is important to start with teachers.
      "We must train our future teachers to work with children with disabilities. Therefore, in 2017, for pedagogical specialties, we introduced the subject of inclusive education. For example, there are 25 children in the class. Of these, 2 children require special attention. On this subject, future teachers will be taught how to present the school curriculum to these children, how to work with them, how to evaluate them," Askhat Aimagambetov said.

      Vice Minister of National Economy Serik Zhumangarin told in an exclusive interview with PrimeMinister.kz about the extent to which tariffs for public utilities are reduced in the regions and in the whole country, as well as about the state's savings.

      The vice minister noted that for implementing the Presidential instructions given at the Security Council meeting Nov. 7, 2018, comprehensive work was carried out for 40 days. Despite the fact that in the framework of the implementation of the tariff limit policy, there should have been an increase in the cost of tariffs, thanks to the measures taken, a reduction in the cost of utilities was achieved.
      So, in November 2018, compensating tariffs were introduced, the total amount of which is 14 billion tenge. As the vice minister of national economy explained, the compensating tariff is made up of the amount that was used by the subjects of natural monopolies in a non-targeted manner.
      “If a subject has misused his funds somewhere, we will withdraw these funds from the tariff, and, accordingly, the tariff will be reduced by this amount. A compensation period is selected when the entity needs to compensate this amount,” said Zhumangarin.
      The vice minister explained that the reduction in tariffs would not have a negative impact on the quality of public services.
      “There was a large influx of investment in the housing and utilities sector. More than 1 trillion tenge have already been attracted and these are all extra-budgetary sources. Not a single coin was has been spent from the budget. At the same time, the problem of reducing network wear was solved. Equipment wear was reduced by 1.5% for the first time,” the speaker said, noting that the greatest work was carried out in 2006 and 2008.
      Separate work was carried out to reduce tariffs for both utilities and condominium services. The result is that in February, Kazakhstanis received receipts for utilities rendered in January, already at reduced tariffs. At the same time, consumers were provided with information indicating the cost of services before the decline (until Dec. 31, 2018) and after (from Jan. 1, 2019).
      According to the vice minister, the largest amount among consumers goes beyond heating services. So as a results of the work, the 22% decline occurred in this area. Citizens will save about 6 billion tenge during the year.
      “The largest check is issued for heat, the decline occurred, for example, in the Karaganda region from 2.7% to 22.2% in Shymkent. By water and sewage from 3% in Pavlodar region to 22.7% in Kyzylorda region. On water and sewage systems about 2 billion tenge will be saved, on gas supply, the total savings will be about 5 billion tenge — from 1.5% in the Kyzylorda region to 17.5% in the Almaty region. According to the electricity supply, the residents will save about 14.5 billion tenge: from 2.8% in Almaty to 18% in the Atyrau region,” Zhumangarin informed.
      From the early 2019, taking into account the reduction in tariffs, the economy of the country's population will be almost 28 billion tenge, and taking into account what has been done before, almost 40 billion tenge will remain with consumers.

      Labor market creates new challenges for the population of Kazakhstan, which requires improving the quality of human resources, increase their mobility, reduction of the share of the unproductively employed population. The new productive employment development program of Kazakhstan is designed to respond to these challenges, said the president of "Center for Workforce Development" JSC of MHSD of Kazakhstan Daulet Argandykov during the interview with primeminister.kz.

      According D.Argandykov, the number of economically active population has increased by 11% over the past 10 years, the number of new employees by 1.5 million, the number of unemployed and the self-employed have been reduced. The unemployment rate decreased by 47% and amounted to 4.9% of the economically active population. In recent years, more than 700 thousand people were involved in the activities of "ERM-2020".
      "However, the problem is the low quality of human resources. The proportion of those who have only basic, secondary, general and primary education remains. Another problem is the demographic imbalance. According to target assessment it is planned that the country's population will amount to more than 24.5 million by 2050. In 2050, the population of the northern regions can be reduced to 0.9 million, in south will grow by more than 5 million, and the density of settlement of the southern regions will be by 4 times more than north. At the same time, 38% of the population, excluding Almaty, lives in the southern regions. While the share of regional products makes only 17%. But in the northern regions, 29% of the population accounts for 25% of gross regional product. This suggests that the economy is diversified, and if we talk about south - almost 60% accounted for trade and other services. The necessary measures are necessary to promote labor mobility," Daulet Argandykov said.  
      He added that the share of unproductive employment, the self-employed, is maintained. Having a large area, there is low density, insufficient capacity of the labor market in rural areas. All of this creates challenges for the labor market.
      "Accordingly, the first objective of productive employment development program and mass business is to create an effective system of obtaining marketable professional qualifications, skills; training, taking into account the demand from employers. It is clear that it is impossible to create a large number of wage jobs in rural areas, so we will also continue to develop entrepreneurship, micro-credit. But unlike "ERM-2020," it is supposed to extend the measures in the city," D.Argandykov added.
      It is also planned to create a single digital platform in the labor market on the basis of the online resource for job search and staff selection enbek.kz.
      "The development of labor market, the creation of a digital platform is directly involved in our" Centre of workforce development." In general, MHSD of Kazakhstan together with the mayors’ office handle employment issues. We ask all those who are looking for work or employees to find more information at this website, " addressed to the people of Kazakhstan D.Argandykov.
      The main goal of the program is to reduce unproductive employment, unemployment. Free support will be given to 9-11 graduates, who were unable to enroll in schools, so that they could gain skills and become competitive in the labor market. In this direction it is planned to train about 21 thousand people. Short courses will be given to 26-30 thousand people.
      It should be reminded that the new productive employment and mass entrepreneurship program was reviewed at the meeting of the Government, which was held on November 29.

      Samruk-Kazyna SWF launches a new platform for electronic procurement in July this year. In the new platform, a full cycle will be performed from planning the demand for goods, works and services, carrying out purchases, signing and executing contracts. The developer of the system is a Kazakh company. This was told by Deputy General Director of Samruk-Kazyna Contract LLP, Bolat Zhumagaliev, at the press conference in the Government.

      In July this year, a new electronic procurement site is being launched. The implementation of all procurement processes in one life cycle on a single site will allow the Fund to monitor the status of procedures in real time, a qualitative and integrated analysis, identify errors, and respond promptly to complaints from suppliers.
      As Bolat Zhumagaliev noted, the new electronic procurement platform ISEP 2.0 will create convenient conditions for the use of an electronic platform for customers and suppliers, will lead to a reduction in costs for maintaining the electronic platform, and will ensure transparency of purchases through blockchain technology.
      "Improving the purchasing activity of the Samruk-Kazyna SWF introduces in-house audit, which defines ‘risk profiles,’ pre-determined, fixed criteria, assessment of the risk system and compliance with the requirements of the basic procurement rules. To date, the current system tender.sk.kz tracks about 18% of the risks, and the new system introduced will fix about 55% of the ‘risk profiles’ and thereby close more than half of the risks of the violations committed, already directly by building the logic business processes in automation," Bolat Zhumagaliev said.
      In order to increase the transparency of the Prequalification process, it is proposed to create an appeal committee to consider complaints involving representatives of the Fund, Atameken NCE, and independent auditors.
      "In general, we want to transfer all the procurement functionality to this platform, i.e. there will be a single procurement portal, starting from planning and ending with the conclusion and execution of contracts. We want to create a platform that will be convenient for all users, including potential suppliers, customers, where a friendly interface will help optimize the use of this platform and provide more elaborate tools," Bolat Zhumagaliev said.
      According to the speaker, the logic of building business processes through automation will help avoid any mistakes in the system by definition.
      "One of the principal innovations is that customers will make decisions on this portal, approve their procurement plans, make decisions on the announcement, conclude contracts online, i.e. this allows all participants and users of the system to see the current information on the portal. Thus, we want to ensure the trust in the system on this portal. We tell all users: we have openness and transparency, everything is decomposed clearly enough," Bolat Zhumagaliev underlined.
      He also said that upon completion of the system development and commissioning, it is planned to integrate it with state registers and with other independent data sources, thus the new platform will become universal.
      "The new platform is developed using Open Source software. We relieved ourselves from the necessity of having to pay license fees to foreign tenders. The creators of our system are domestic developers. Having eliminated the need for expensive technical support, from license fees, we save about 150 million tenge per year," Bolat Zhumagaliev explained.
      Responding to journalists' questions about the security of the new portal, Bolat Zhumagaliev noted that the development is under the control of a specialized working group of the fund, which includes, among other things, the information security service, i.e. crash tests, attack tests are conducted, independent companies in this field are involved, who carry out before the industrial launch tests for vulnerability, to eliminate them.
      "On security, all this work is done in a mandatory manner, since we understand that the system is quite serious, these risks must be taken into account. Regarding security, including the security of data, we placed our information base on two independent data centers, i.e. servers are located in different places, both in Astana and outside it. This allows us, in the event of even some theoretical catastrophe of one of the data centers, to pass smoothly to the second double, and the system will also work safely. All this has been tested," Bolat Zhumagaliyev summed up.

      Jan. 17 at the press conference in the press center of the Government, Vice Minister of Industry and Infrastructure Development Kairbek Uskenbayev spoke about the measures taken to improve the availability and quality of housing.

      As Uskenbayev noted, 2018 was very successful in terms of housing construction.
      “Following the 2018 results, 12.5 million m² of housing was commissioned, which is 12.1% higher than 2017 level. Over 113 thousand families have improved their housing conditions,” the vice minister informed.
      In 2018, 1.2 trillion tenge was invested in housing construction. This is more than 2017 level by 8.1%. The main share of investments — 86% — is investments of private developers and the population. For 1 tenge of public funds 6 tenge of private investment was attracted.
      The volume of commissioned housing in 2018 increased in comparison with 2017 by 12.1%. Investments in the construction of individual housing amounted to 459 billion tenge, apartment residential buildings — 702 billion tenge. At the expense of private investment, 5.7 million m² or more than 39 thousand individual houses, as well as 6.8 million m² or more than 74 thousand apartment buildings were commissioned. The increase in housing input is observed in all regions of the republic.
      Speaking about the results of the implementation of the Nurly Zher state program in 2018, the vice minister recalled that the program provides a mechanism for returning and re-investing in housing construction. This means that once invested money in the implementation of the program on a returnable basis is constantly invested in the housing construction of the country.
      In connection with the adoption of the 7-20-25 program on behalf of the Head of State, from 2019 the amount of funding for the construction of engineering communications has been increased: from 80 billion tenge to 100 billion tenge.
      Within the framework of the Nurly Zher program, financing of rental and credit housing is provided.

      Akimats funded projects in the area of ​​"Construction of credit housing" (on a revolving basis). Every year in the country, about 200 billion tenge is allocated for the construction of housing. According to him, the construction of housing in this area will only increase.
      Within the framework of one more direction of the Nurly Zher program — “Stimulation of housing construction by private developers” — through Damu Bank, subsidies are provided to loans of construction companies for housing construction. Seven percent of the interest rate is subsidized. Banks issued loans of 152 billion tenge.
      “The mortgage program 7-20-25 and the Nurly Zher program complement each other remarkably well. If 7-20-25 gives people access to funds to purchase this housing, then Nurly Zher is aimed at providing our residents with apartments at an affordable price,” said Uskenbayev.

At the end of the year, it is expected to commission more than 500 thousand square meters of housing (over 9 thousand apartments).
      Since the start of the implementation, 248.1 thousand m² of rental housing has been built, or 4,592 apartments (in 2017 — 146.5 thousand m² or 2,620 apartments, for 11 months of 2018 — 101.6 thousand m² or 1972 apartments).

      During the implementation of the State Program, the interest of Kazakhstanis has increased significantly in individual housing construction. Persons who are in line to receive the land can become a participant in this direction. In 2017, in the regional centers, a pilot project on the construction of individual housing in a single architectural style through a single developer using local materials and technologies of a house-building factory was launched. The application of these technologies to standard construction projects will ensure the construction cost of 1 m² of housing no more than 120 thousand tenge.
      The queues, registered in akimats for land plots, have the right to participate in the pilot project and independently buy out the finished house with the land plot and utility communications or receive preferential loans in Housing Construction Savings Bank for its purchase.
      With such approaches, the monthly payment for the waiting list will be in the first 5 years — 70 thousand tenge, in the next 10 years — 56 thousand tenge. These measures will allow to introduce about 40 thousand houses (4 million m²) annually. So, in 2017, 184 houses were commissioned.
      In 2018, continued implementation of pilot projects for the construction of individual housing in a single architectural style. At the expense of the republican budget, the networks of water and electricity are supplied. According to preliminary data, 160 houses were commissioned in 2018. In addition, construction of 179 houses is underway, design and estimate documentation for 20 houses has been developed and a tender for construction has been announced, expert assessment reports have been received for 54 projects with an area of ​​5.08 thousand square meters.
      As part of the development of individual housing construction, in 2018, about 40 thousand land plots for individual housing construction are being equipped with engineering communications.
      Summing up, it should be noted that the President of Kazakhstan always puts the solution to the housing issues of Kazakhstanis at the forefront. In the Address “Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Incomes and Quality of Life,” the Head of State noted that high-quality social services should be harmoniously accompanied by the creation of wide opportunities for improving living conditions, comfortable and safe living in any settlement of the country.
      In general, according to the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development, housing construction and disbursement of funds are under the constant control of the department. Housing construction is actively developing, which contributes to a significant improvement in the living conditions of citizens, an increase in the construction rate, as well as the growth of entrepreneurial initiatives. It is planned that in 2019 from all sources of financing more than 13 million m² of housing will be commissioned. And this is more than 100 thousand dwellings.

      The amendments to the bankruptcy law allow enterprises to find new ways out of the crisis, said the director of the Tax Control Department of State Revenue Committee Yerlan Nurlanbayev during a press conference at CCS.

      According to Y. Nurlanbayev, the Law of Kazakhstan "On amendments on rehabilitation and bankruptcy" was adopted within the framework of the Plan of the nation; it allows enterprises to find new ways out of the crisis, including after the recognition of their bankruptcy.
      "One of the main areas of the law is to regulate insolvency. If the enterprise has debts it necessarily will be bankrupted. The law allows the debtor to negotiate with the creditors and to agree about terms of paying it back. He is given 2 months for that. This is not accrued penalty and no one can file for bankruptcy. The agreement will be approved by the court, and the borrower will return to normal activities. Payments to creditors are made according to schedule," Y. Nurlanbayev.
      According to him, the law focuses on the transition from rehabilitation to bankruptcy.
      "It happens that the owner of the debtor got a chance to pull his business out of debt, but bankruptcy mechanism is already running. The new law allows to go from bankruptcy to rehabilitation. It is necessary to develop a rehabilitation plan, coordinate it with all creditors and to send to the court. From the date of application rehabilitation on the basis of the plan developed by the bankruptcy procedure is
      In addition, the law allows the debtor to enter into a settlement agreement with all creditors at any stage of bankruptcy.
      "Prerequisite: debts on wages must be pre-repaid. The court's decision to declare the debtor bankrupt shall not be implemented after court approval of the settlement agreement," he explained.

      The meeting of the Government chaired by Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev considered the set of measures for optimization of the processes for providing public services by the State Corporation “Government for citizens” 

      Minister of Information and Communications Dauren Abayev reported on the transfer of public services to the State Corporation “Government for citizens”. The meeting of the interdepartmental commission on May 12 has decided to transfer 37 types of public services to the 548 already provided through the State Corporation, including 27 "paper" services. Another 48 service types, after introduction of changes to the standards, will be provided on the non-alternative basis only through the State Corporation, which is aimed at avoiding any contacts of citizens with service providers.
      At the same time, the number of documents, required from citizens is continuing to decrease. The analysis showed, that in 2016 18 million electronic certificates were received only for 5 public services (address information, certificate of real estate absence, of registered rights, of pension contributions and police clearance certificate). The exclusion of their requirement “on a paper” will significantly decrease the time and material costs of Kazakhstani people and reduce the congestions of people in PSCs.
      Also, a mechanism to request the receipt of personal data from a citizen, through the e-Government web portal will be implemented for private organizations and third parties.
      Besides this, from July 1, 20 state services will be available on the e-Government web portal, which can be obtained without an EDS. In the future, the number of services rendered via one-time password or login and password will be increased.

      According to the Ministry of Investment and Development, among the identified problems that hamper the effective functioning of industrial zones, the main ones are the lack of legislative regulation of their activities and absence of a single state body responsible for the policy of creating and operating zones.

      It also requires legislative regulation of land issues, which provides a simplified procedure for registration, the legal basis for the return of land, in case of unfair or irrational use and guarantees for transferring the land plot to investors after the project is implemented. 
      In Kazakhstan today there are 22 industrial zones with a ready infrastructure for processing industry projects in the regions. 107 production facilities have been launched, with investments amounting to 100 billion tenge. 7,700 jobs were created.

      The Prime Minister of Kazakhstan held a meeting on the activities of the local police service.

      Karim Massimov listened to how zero tolerance is provided for household crimes.
      At the Ministry of Internal Affairs, under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, Karim Massimov, a meeting was held with the participation of the Heads of Ministries, the Heads of Regional Departments of the local police force and Internal Affairs Departments.
      The meeting was attended by the Chairman of the Supreme Court, Kairat Mami, the Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration M.Beketaev, Attorney General Zh.Asanov, the Head of the Office of the Prime Minister, E.Koshanov, as well as the Heads of the Ministry of Health and Social Development, Finance, and National Economy.
      The Minister of Internal Affairs reported on the formation and the measures being taken to improve the performance of the local police service.
      The local police service, launched earlier this year in response to the 30th step of the Plan of the Nation - 100 concrete steps to implement the five institutional reforms, has made it possible for the bodies of the Internal Affairs to adopt a new format, ensuring public order and safety.
      This ensures adherence to a zero tolerance policy for minor offenses, and the fight against household crimes.
      The legislation established the accountability of the local police service to the local community, while mayors are now entitled to assign tasks to the local police and monitor their execution. The Head of the local police reports regularly to the akimats, maslikhats and the community, who in turn provide feedback on the quality of the service.
      All these changes are aimed at improving the efficiency and transparency of the police, based on cooperation with local authorities and the population.
      During the meeting, reports of the Heads of the local police service and the Department of Internal Affairs of a number of regions were presented.
      Before the meeting, the Prime Minister visited a number of objects and units of the Local Police Service in Astana. In JSC "Astana Innovations'" Massimov was familiarized with new technologies being introduced in the framework of the project "Safe city". Alongside that, the capabilities of the System of the complex maintenance of daily activities in Astana were also demonstrated.
      The Prime Minister also visited the police department of the "Saryarka" district, got acquainted with the results of the work of the local police service in the area, visited the regiment of the road patrol police of the Local Police Service , the Department of Internal Affairs of the city and a special emergency response department squad, where he was shown the modern equipment of the police, and a presentation of the project of a new framework for special forces was held.
      The creation of a local police service, accountable to the local executive bodies and local community is a result of the implementation of the 30th-step of the Plan of the Nation - 100 concrete steps. In this context, on November 2, 2015, the Head of State signed the Law ,"On amendments and additions to some legislative acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the issues of activity of the Local Police Service".
      In order to determine the main objectives of the local police, the actual needs of society, related to the provision of public order and stability were taken into account. Among them are the prevention of crime, protection of public order, road safety, the prevention and suppression of criminal offenses, proceedings in cases of administrative offenses and pre-trial investigation in the form of a protocol on criminal misdemeanors.
      At the same time, the competence of the Akim in the organization of the activities of the local police service were greatly expanded. The Akim now has the right to set objectives for the Local Police Service, in ensuring the protection of public order and demanding their execution.
      The main criterion for evaluating the activities of the local police is public opinion, the Head of the Local Police Service must report at least twice a year - before the akimats and maslikhats, and once a year - to the public.
      Since the beginning of the year, about 7.1 thousand reporting meetings of District Inspectors of the Police for the population were held, which was attended by about 900 thousand people.

      By the beginning of the new academic year, the Ministry of Education and Science is preparing an instruction letter stating that workbooks are additional material for training and they are not mandatory for application. Vice Minister of Education and Science Askhat Aimagambetov told about this today at the press conference following the meeting of the Government.

      According to the Ministry of Education and Science, the requirements of schools for parents to buy workbooks for primary school students are illegal.
      "The purchase and use of workbooks is not necessary. This is an additional material for learning, which can be recommended, but not necessary for general application. The requirements for the purchase of workbooks are illegal, so in such cases we will apply the appropriate measures. However, we can not prohibit their use. There are also textbooks for various subjects, which are also optional. Today, parents complain that school backpacks are very heavy because of the abundance of books. This is reasonable, because sometimes the workbook is not smaller than the textbook itself, so now the Ministry of Education and Science together with the Ministry of Healthcare is developing clear standards that should lead to sanitary norms in all textbooks, workbooks and other teaching aids," said Aimagambetov.
      During the press conference, the vice minister also said that a new system of certification of pedagogical workers has been introduced in Kazakhstan in 2018, where, depending on the category, wages are rising and a certain surcharge is added to this salary.
      "When we talk about wage increases, there are two components. The first is a pay increase for those who work today under the updated programs, and this is 205,000 teachers. They already receive this surcharge, corresponding funds were allocated from the republican budget, transfers were sent to local budgets. As for the second part, it is a surcharge for the category. Now the salary scale of teachers is differentiated and depends on various components," Aimagambetov summed up.

      Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev took part in the session of the Senate of the Parliament, during which the draft Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On the National Budget for 2019-2021,” previously approved by the Mazhilis of the Parliament, and the Law “On the Guaranteed Transfer from the National Fund of Kazakhstan for 2019-2021" were considered.

      The
      were presented by the Ministers of National Economy Timur Suleimenov, Minister of Finance Alikhan Smailov and Chairman of the National Bank Daniyar Akishev.
      In general, the draft budget is aimed at solving three key tasks. These are ensuring the fulfillment of all social commitments made, the seven priority policies and reforms in the framework of the Strategy 2025 and the implementation of the Head of State’s Address “Growing Welfare of the Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Incomes and Quality of Life.” Thus, for the implementation of the President’s Address, the disbursements to the social unit increased by 110 billion tenge for the minimum wage rise from Jan.1, 2019, to 42,500 tenge, the construction of schools by — 50 billion tenge for three years, work of school psychologists, etc.
      Prime Minister Sagintayev, answering the questions of deputies, noted that the Head of State in his Address “Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Income and Quality of Life” drew attention to this component of the Government’s work. Thus, the Government is conducting systematic work to reduce the share of the shadow economy — a plan has been adopted for 2018–2020.
      According to statistics, since 2013 and to date, there has been a decrease in the volume of the shadow economy from 28% to 25%. To this end, some legislative changes of a stimulating, restrictive, administrative nature have also been developed. For example, non-cash payments will be prohibited between enterprises that operate on the basis of a patent and legal entities within a 1000-fold MCI. Sagintayev also identified the need to switch from 2020 to the massive use of online cash registers. It was noted that, according to the initial agreement with Atameken NCE, this work should have been started from 2024, but from 2018, cash registers on 17 types of goods are already in operation. From 2019, it is planned to switch to companies that operate in open markets. From 2020, enterprises that use a single land tax will be covered. Thus, from 2020, all small and medium-sized businesses will work on online cash registers. In order to ensure that there is no burden on small businesses, government incentives are applied. Taxes are reduced by 60,000 tenge, this will allow entrepreneurs to purchase cash registers.
      At the same time, from 2020 all trade markets of the country should switch to a stationary format of work. In most regions, this work is already being actively carried out.
      In addition, a lot of work is carried out under the Digital Kazakhstan State Program. In particular, the Astana-1 program has been launched at the border, electronic invoices, product labeling, the Nur Zholy checkpoint with the latest equipment and machinery has recently started its work at the border with China. During the 9 months of operation of these programs, the Kazakhstani services additionally revealed violations by participants in foreign economic activity, which reduce the volume of imports and the cost of imported goods. Notifications of violations worth 44 billion tenge were sent. As a result of these measures, all of these companies added up to 44 billion tenge in the budget. In 2019, it is assumed that thanks to this work, 520 billion tenge will go to the budget. This figure is reflected in the three-year budget.
      During the meeting, the deputies also addressed a number of questions to Deputy Prime Minister Erbolat Dossaev, Ministers of National Economy Timur Suleimenov, Energy — Kanat Bozumbayev, Finance — Alikhan Smailov, Labor and Social Protection of the Population — Madina Abylkassymova, Vice Minister of Culture and Sports Aktoty Raimkulova.
      Concluding the discussion of the issue, Bakytzhan Sagintayev thanked the deputies for their support and prompt consideration of the three-year budget. The budget is really aimed at the execution of the instructions voiced in the Address of the Head of State.
      It should be noted that today the Government approved an Action Plan for the implementation of the budget. In October-November 2018, the necessary decisions were taken to implement the budget. To date, the preparatory work is being completed on some laws that are necessary for the implementation of the instructions of the Head of State: they are under consideration by Parliament.
      In general, this budget will contribute to improving the welfare of Kazakhstan. At the same time, the Prime Minister stressed that the issues raised at the Senate meeting will be systematically considered in the upcoming work of the Government.
      According to the results of consideration, the draft law was submitted to the Mazhilis, as amended by deputies of the Senate.

      The VII Civil Forum of Kazakhstan is a unique platform created for dialogue and the consolidation of efforts between the government and members of civil society organizations. The meeting of delegates held in the National Museum of Kazakhstan in the framework of the celebration of the 25th anniversary of Independence of Kazakhstan.

      Participants and guests of the Forum were the regional and national NGOs, MPs, representatives of central and local executive bodies, representatives of international organizations, experts and media.
      At the plenary session of the forum "The state and prospects of development of civil society" was attended by Deputy Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Imangali Tasmagambetov. During the discussion, Deputy Prime Minister stressed the important constructive role played by non-governmental organizations in the socio-economic and public life of the country.
      "From the very beginning of independence, non-governmental organizations were at the origins of such global problems as the closure of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, the restoration of Small Aral Sea, the protection of motherhood and childhood. They all found support and were always in sight of the Head of State. It is hard to imagine the scope of which would remain without attention of the civil initiative," Tasmagambetov said.
      According to Vice Prime Minister, Kazakhstan has more than 18,000 non-governmental organizations; more than eight thousand NGOs are actively working. About 30 thousand people are employed in the civil sector. This is mainly operating in the sphere of youth policy and children's initiatives, support for socially vulnerable groups, education and science, sports and physical education, promotion of healthy lifestyle and protection of the rights and legal interests of citizens and organizations.

      At the press conference in the Government’s site, Chairman of the Committee for Construction, Housing and Communal Services of the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development Markhabat Zhayymbetov spoke about the ongoing work to provide large families with housing.

      According to Zhayymbetov, there are 28 thousand large families waiting for housing in the akimats. For seven years it is planned to build 6 thousand rental apartments annually for such families. Until 2025, more than 40 thousand rental apartments will be built.
      “As the Head of State ordered, for 28 thousand in the housing queue, we must build 42 thousand apartments in seven years. For 23 years, 50 billion tenge will be allocated. Approximate cost of apartments will start from 8 million 400 thousand tenge — for 60 m
      with 1 square meter at a price of 140 thousand tenge, the higher prices will be reimbursed by the local budget,” Zhayymbetov said.
      The chairman stressed that the issuance of housing will be coordinated by placing different types of large families in a separate queue.
      “Mothers of many children are in the queue for civil servants, for people with disabilities, so we have identified 28 thousand in akimats as of Jan. 1, 2019. According to the law, each person must have at least 15 square meters,” he said.
      Zhayymbetov said that the program of rental housing for low-income large families will be launched after making changes to the regulations in the second half of the year.
      “If an apartment costs 8 million tenge, 800 thousand can be reimbursed through a housing certificate. Two percent for 19 years: a pre-loan will be reimbursed for eight years, this is 42 thousand tenge a month, and then a two-percent housing loan for the next nine years is about 27 thousand. This is affordable enough,” the chairman added.

      Jan. 22 at a press conference following a meeting of the Government Vice Minister of Finance Ruslan Beketayev spoke about the main innovations in public procurement and procurement of the quasi-public sector.

      If in previous years, the work of the Ministry of Finance in the development of public procurement was aimed at enhancing the transparency of procedures, today this task has already been completed. As noted by the vice minister, the ministry’s current work on improving public procurement focuses on quality and fair approach.
      “100% of our public procurement procedures have been converted to electronic format and, accordingly, we believe that great emphasis should be placed on quality. By setting the thresholds for dumping, we thereby determine the aspect that companies that perfectly understand what the price should be will take part in the procurement. Also the fact that the reduction, conditionally during construction, will not fall below 10%, will just guarantee quality,” said Beketayev.
      Meanwhile, the bill defines that the main criterion for selection will be work experience. Companies will compete in terms of work experience and the relative price will be determined based on this.
      “The notional price will determine the winner in most cases. But, if setting the dumping, we can see the situation that everyone has gone down on these 10% and we can not determine the winner, respectively, here the determining factor will be the payment of taxes. Our ideology is such that whoever pays taxes should participate in government procurement, and, accordingly, whoever pays more should win, therefore we often see that companies that do not have experience and do not pay taxes, lower prices and win. And then they could not finish building the object, which led to the non-mastering or poor-quality performance of their tasks,” Beketayev explained.
      In addition, as part of the centralization of public procurement, for the Unified Procurement Organizers at the republican, regional and district levels, the Ministry of Finance approved the corresponding lists of goods, works and services, which are effective from March 1, 2019.
      According to Beketayev, this innovation is due to the release of state institutions, whose work is focused on the performance of social duties, from non-characteristic functions, as well as an increase in efficiency with a single purchase.
      “Firstly, state institutions such as schools, hospitals, social facilities whose main activity is aimed at training and providing social services are participating in public procurement. And the ideology of this amendment is to free from those unusual functions of the state institutions that should deal with other issues. Firstly, centralization will enable optimal procurement, which will effectively affect a single institution,” said Beketayev.
      Recall, in order to improve the scope of public procurement and procurement in the quasi-state sector, Dec. 26, 2018, the Head of State signed the law “On Amendments and Additions to Certain Legislative Acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Public Procurement and Procurement in the Quasi-Public Sector,” which came into force Jan. 1, 2019.

      Minister of Information and Communications of Kazakhstan Dauren Abayev instructed department of the agency to ensure the provision of public services through "Government for Citizens" corporation in electronic form at least 60%, and complete the connection to the new integrated system of 53 public services until the end of 2016.

      "Today, we can receive public services by 3 main ways: "electronic government" portal; "Government for citizens" State Corporation; unified contact center on the provision of public services. During the first 9 months of 2016, more than 30 million electronic services were rendered, 17.4 thousand electronic licenses, 433.5 thousand permits were given, about 800 thousand people were registered," D. Abayev said at the board meeting devoted to summing up results of work for 9 months.
      According to the Minister, on behalf of the Head of State , "Government for citizens" state-owned corporation was  created by merging four state-owned enterprises, such as PSC, Real Estate Center, State Center for pension payments, Scientific-Production Center of Land Cadaster.
      "As of October 1, 2016. the state corporation rendered services to more than 29 million people. Today, there are 739 types of public services in the Register of public services, 530 of them are available through "electronic government" portal o and State Corporation. A single number 1414 put into operation for the convenience of the citizens, where anyone can get advice on obtaining government services, required documents and the current stage of the application filed by them, " the head of department said.
      In addition, the minister noted the corruption risks. As an example, he cited the detained employee of the State Corporation on the fact of corruption in Petropavlovsk.
      "I think these facts gave us bad reputation. Therefore, I instruct to strengthen measures to prevent such incidents in the future. You will carry all personal responsibility. Department of the Ministry of public services in conjunction with the State Corporation should ensure the provision of public services through the State Corporation in electronic form at least 60%, and complete the connection to the new integrated system of 53 public services, transferred to the State Corporation, until the end of 2016," D.

      During the interview for the PrimeMinister.kz official site, Chairman of Kazakhstan Center for Modernization and Development of Housing and Public Utilities Nursultan Dzhienbayev told about the planned digitalization of the infrastructure and housing, and its advantages.

      According to Dzhienbayev, the Kazakhstan Center for Modernization and Development of Housing and Public Utilities over the last year has been actively working to find and attract companies that offer innovative technologies for utilities in Kazakhstan.
      As it is known, today in Kazakhstan there is a big problem with the wear and tear of engineering networks, which entails high heat losses and, as a consequence, an increase in public utility bills. Simply put, the consumer pays not only for the heat actually consumed, but also for heat loss during its transportation. Today, modern technologies to extend the service life of pipelines are practically not used, the problem is solved by the costly replacement of pipes. Therefore, the investment programs of natural monopolies entail an increase in existing tariffs.
      To solve this problem, KazCenter is working on the selection of optimal modern technologies that are being tested in several pilot cities of Kazakhstan. These technologies are high-tech equipment that can extend the life cycle of pipes.
      For example, in Kyzylorda, equipment of the German company Merus was installed at a site of 10 km, which made it possible to reduce the iron content by 86%. This, as Dzhienbayev noted, is very much. Roughly speaking, if the life cycle of a new pipe in a normal environment is 30 years, then due to an aggressive environment, this cycle is reduced to 10 years. Thus, using equipment that reduces the iron content in water, you can guarantee the service life of the pipe to 30, and maybe even 50 years.
      At the same time, there is a huge savings due to a decrease in the investment need of natural monopolies for the implementation of projects for the modernization and reconstruction of engineering networks. Thus, we can talk about a possible reduction in the tariffs themselves for the services of these subjects.
      According to Dzhienbayev, KazCenter is now a fairly large pool of foreign technologies that are being tested. These are not only technologies of the German company Merus, there are also technologies from Canadian, Japanese and other companies that are being implemented as pilot projects in the cities of Astana, Almaty, Kyzylorda, Atyrau, Aktobe, Lisakovsk. In the future, successful experience will be scaled throughout the country, it is even possible to localize the production of high-tech equipment in Kazakhstan.
      Also Dzhienbayev expressed confidence that within three years the country will reach 100% provision with devices.
      It is worth noting that there are several stages of adjustment. The first is the metering devices themselves, the second is automatic heat points. When installing home-based metering devices, a resident's savings can reach from 30% to 40%, depending on the region.
      “For the check it is very noticeable. If you were used to pay 7,500 tenge, you will pay 2,700 tenge less. This is a very good indicator. However, taking a complex approach and installing automatic heat supply points (points that have sensors outside and inside the house. Depending on the air temperature outside, they regulate the heat supply temperature of the house), then there will be a saving in consumption of gigacalories," said Dzhienbayev.
      The analysis shows that, on average in the country, when installing house heat meters without installing an automatic heat supply station, the payment for heat of a two-room apartment with an area of ​​60 m² will drop to 36% or an average of 2,720 tenge. On a national scale, this savings in monetary terms can reach 32.5 billion tenge per year.
      The second example is the savings after the installation of a general house heat metering and automatic heat supply station on the example of an apartment with an area of ​​29.8 m² in Aktobe. As can be seen from the receipt, in October 2017 the heating cost was 3,547 tenge. After the installation of heat metering devices and an automatic heat supply station in October 2018, the payment for heating was 466 tenge, i.e. the savings were 3,081 tenge (86.8%).
      As Dzhienbayev noted, for the full-scale introduction of house-wide metering devices for heat and automatic heat points, work is underway to attract investments and funds from second-tier banks.
      “Our task now is to raise funds. We are now actively working with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in order to launch this program and the population feel this savings,” he said.
      In addition, the chairman noted that Kazakhstani developers are ready to participate in the appliance program. Also, some work will be done with the population.
      “People see that there are real savings. This is not a saving of 50-100 tenge, these savings amount to thousands. We will separately talk with the population,” Dzhienbayev noted.
      In conclusion, the chairman of KazCenter stressed that all measures for the modernization of the sphere will be based only on new technologies.
      “We will not deal with patching holes, we will introduce new technologies that are more efficient and much cheaper than just repairing or changing equipment. The task is to fully equip the country by the end of 2022. I think we can do it faster. Everything will depend on how we work together in the financial part with foreign banks, second-tier banks, with our state bodies,” concluded Dzhienbayev.

      The economic impact from standardization of the corporate functions of the national companies will amount to approximately 300 billion KZT by 2020.

      Samruk-Kazyna JSC introduces new standards in such functions as Accounting and Tax Accounting, Treasury, Human Resources Management, IT Management, Data Governance, Operational Planning, etc.
      The reason for the inefficient performance of any company usually lies in the inefficient organisation of its daily operations. This may be a duplication of functions, fulfillment of unnecessary tasks, staff overage or the lack of specialists with relevant background. All this is forcing the company to bear substantial hidden costs, and does not allow to address the strategic objectives aimed at maximising benefits, said Adamas Ilkevicius, Managing Director for Transformation and Special Projects of Samruk-Kazyna JSC.
      According to him, reference models are universal and can be applied to any large Kazakhstani companies. 
      However, they do not take into account the specifics of each individual company, in terms of the nature of its activities (mining, postal services, power energy and any other industry). Thus the task of each portfolio company is to adapt them to fit their own needs," noted A.Ilkevicius.
      It should be noted that business reengineering and standardization of corporate functions are one of the most important initiatives implemented within the framework of the comprehensive Transformation Programme of Samruk-Kazyna JSC, which currently covers Kazakhstan Temir Zholy NC JSC, Kazpost JSC, KazMunayGas NC JSC, Kazatomprom NAC JSC, Samruk-Energу JSC and KEGOC JSC.

In particular, he spoke about supporting the low-income segments of the population and large families.

      The Head of State at the XVIII Congress of the Nur Otan Party was tasked to ensure a decent standard of living for citizens.
      Minister of Labor and Social Protection of the Population Berdibek Saparbayev said that in accordance with the instruction, from July 1, 2019, wages of individual public sector employees will be increased to 30%.

      In addition, from July 1, 2019, wages will be raised to grass-roots workers of executive bodies who work directly with citizens at the district and regional levels.
      According to Saparbayev, the salary increase will cover about 78 thousand state employees of rural, district and regional akimats. The average salary increase will be 25%. For these purposes, the state will additionally allocate about 77 billion tenge over three years.
      Saparbayev also informed about measures to support low-income families, whose income for each family member does not exceed 70% of the subsistence minimum.
      To support low-income families, from Jan. 1, 2018, targeted social assistance has been introduced.
      The new format of social assistance is comprehensive:
      At the end of 2018, 571 thousand people or 111 thousand families became recipients of targeted social assistance. All able-bodied recipients of TSA were given assistance in finding employment. Measures of social adaptation covered 125 thousand people. The measures taken allowed more than 44 thousand people to get out of poverty.
      The minister also reported on changes to the assistance appointment mechanism, which will come into force on July 1, 2019.
      , the criteria for the appointment of TSA will increase from 50% to 70% of the subsistence minimum per person, that is, from 14,849 to 20,789 tenge in 2019;
      when appointing the assistance, the allowances to large families and mothers with many children who hold Kumіs Alqa and Altyn Alqa pendants, as well as disability benefits for children will be excluded from the total family income;
      , a guaranteed assistance in the amount of 70% of the subsistence minimum (20,789 tenge) will be paid monthly for each child from a low-income family. The size of the TSA for adult family members will be calculated as before.
      Saparbayev noted that this will allow an average increase in aid by 40%. As a result, these measures will cover more than 830 thousand people.
      the procedure for assigning the assistance through the optimization of the requested documents will be simplified. So, all the necessary documents will be requested through the information systems of state bodies. In case of lack of information in information systems, specialists from employment centers or rural akimats will draw up requests to the relevant state bodies.
      “Electronic social cards will be formed in the regions. They will include an assessment of the needs, the social conditions of each family. Currently, work is underway to make changes and amendments to the regulatory legal acts,” the minister said.

      The changes provide state families with large grants for new business ideas for 505 thousand tenge on a non-refundable basis. As part of microcredit in 2019, 5 thousand microcredits are to be spent on the development of entrepreneurship among mothers of large families and persons with disabilities in the village. As a result, 15 thousand large families will have the opportunity to do their own business and increase income. Also, mothers with many children and persons with disabilities in the village will be provided with preferential microloans in the amount of up to 6.5 million tenge to open their own business and up to 20 million tenge for the development of anchor cooperation.
      In addition, short-term training for professions in demand will be organized for large families with low income rural families. Certain social jobs at home will be created with wage subsidies. This will allow combining childcare and work, as well as an additional source of income.
      “Social support will be strengthened for families caring for children with disabilities. From July 1, 2019, the size of health care for children with disabilities and for persons over 18 years of the first group of disabilities from childhood will be increased. As a result, the size of benefits for 100 thousand citizens will be increased from 31,183 tenge to 41,578 tenge,” Saparbayev said.

      The chairman of the "State Corporation" Government for Citizens " NJSC Ablaykhan Ospanov informed about this today at the press conference on the implementation of the fifth direction "Formation of the Accountable State" of the Nation's Plan "100 Concrete Steps".

      Since July 1, 2017, in order to simplify the receipt of public services, 20 popular public services are available on the e-government portal, which can be obtained without an EDS. The first service available with a single-use SMS password from April this year was the issue of a certificate of non-conviction.
      A.Ospanov said that it is planned to increase the number of state services received without an electronic digital signature. At the same time, he stressed that the use of single-use SMS-passwords does not affect the security of personal data.
      "To receive with the help of a single-use SMS-password, we have selected such services, which are the easiest to obtain. In order for a person to start receiving services using single-use passwords, one must come to the PSC, go through identification, sign an agreement that this number is attached directly to him," A. Ospanov explained.
      It is planned to organize interaction of information systems of various state bodies with a view to excluding citizens from "electronic" inquiries from citizens.
      In addition, the portal Egov.kz plans to introduce a mechanism for obtaining personal data of the citizen through his consent by third parties, for example, the employer. According to A. Ospanov, work in this direction will be completed by the end of this year and already from the beginning of 2018 it will be possible to use this service.
      "Here I would like to note that citizens come to the PSC more actively and "tied" their phone numbers to their IINs. Because when your employer asks for information, you receive a message in your private office or on the phone that someone has requested information about you. If you give consent, the information will be transferred to a third party," A. Ospanov said.
      In addition, further development of the State Corporation "Government for Citizens" is planned to be implemented in the following areas: introduction of the proactive principle of rendering public services; Receiving "electronic" public services without EDS and reducing the number of certificates issued through the PSC "on paper"; the development of the infrastructure of the front offices.

      To implement the President’s instructions, a new tariff scale has been introduced in Kazakhstan, measures have been taken to increase the transparency of the work of natural monopolies, as well as strengthen consumer protection societies. What consumers need to know and what will reduce the volume of services consumed in an interview with PrimeMinister.kz was told by the Vice Minister of National Economy Serik Zhumangarin.

      According to the vice minister, in order to increase the transparency of tariff setting and the quality of the services provided, digital technologies which could significantly modernize the ​​service provision are being introduced in the housing and utilities system.
      “Quite recently, the Head of State signed a new law that came into effect, there are a lot of novelties. Now the applications by natural monopolies will be submitted only in electronic form. If a person has some initial economic skills, he can look at this application and offer his comments,” said Zhumangarin.
      In all regions of the country, 102 public receptions are open, which receive complaints and suggestions from the public, the results of which are checked accordingly. In addition, work is underway to strengthen consumer protection societies. At least three companies will now work in each region, and a qualification requirement has been introduced for the presence of an economic or legal education.
      The vice minister noted that the main part in the cost of utilities is tariffing of heat. In this regard, Zhumangarin gave several recommendations to citizens about simple ways to save on heat and electricity.
      “We are differentiating the tariff: those who have general house heat counts pay less than those who do not have them. Therefore, we must insist that the device be purchased and installed, because there are completely different tariffs, they are much lower,” the vice minister said.
      At the same time, Zhumangarin reported that in Astana, 99% of houses are covered by the appraisal.
      At the same time, the vice minister recommended replacing house-based energy sources with more economical options.
      “These are fairly simple things, for example, to change light bulbs at home, that is, to put modern energy saving bulbs from 8 to 12 watts at home. The same absolutely luminosity, and they are guaranteed. Heat and electricity are the two most financially intensive items of our budget, that is, for example, you can buy a kettle with exactly the same boiling time, but which consumes much less power. In general, when you choose some devices, you need to look at energy consumption,” concluded Zhumangarin.

      The school administration should not require additional documents from the parents, except those specified in the regulations on the provision of public services. Vice Minister of Education and Science Askhat Aimagambetov told this August 7 at the press conference following the meeting of the Government.

      "There can be no entrance examinations for admission to zero classes. If a child is five years old and wants to study, there should not be any obstacles for that," Aimagambetov said.
      The vice minister stressed that now the actual issue when enrolling in zero classes is the package provided by the document, when in some cases it is illegally asked to provide references from the parents' place of work.
      "Inquiries from work that unreasonably require a school are illegal. There is a certain standard, which clearly indicates what documents are needed, and there are no certificates from the place of work," the representative of the Ministry of Education and Science explained.
      Also answering journalists' questions, the vice minister stressed that the ministry approved new model rules for admission of students to schools.
      "Today, certain schools are still overloaded. In Kazakhstan, 118 schools teach children in three shifts. Especially acute is the issue of admission of children to the capital's schools, where annually the number of first-graders is increased by 15,000 children," he said.
      At the same time, Aimagambetov spoke about the possibility of reformatting the testing of school graduates. In his view, the unification of United National Testing and Complex Testing will be financially profitable.
      "Until 2017, the UNT performed two functions at once: a final exam at school for obtaining a certificate and an examination for admission to a higher educational institution. Now when the UNT is divided into two parts, the child passes exams at school to obtain a certificate and hands in separately the Unified National Test. Complex testing has exactly the same function and is passed after two weeks and there is no need for it. This is a big expense for the state. In general, all the urgent issues, including the proposals for UNT, will be discussed at the August meeting of teachers. We will listen to the opinion of our colleagues and come to a consensus on certain controversial issues," Aimagambetov said.
      Recall, August 7 at the meeting of the Government chaired by the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, Minister of Education and Science Yerlan Sagadiyev announced proposals from the pedagogical community and parents to improve the process of UNT and CT. Thus, the issues of UNT and CT unification, the exemption of school teachers from UNT, the abolition of testing in schools, the award of grants without language binding to the language of instruction are being considered.

      The official site of Akorda has published the full text of the Address of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev to the people of Kazakhstan dated January 31, 2017.

       
      I am addressing the people of Kazakhstan as we approach the new era.
      The country has honorably passed its 25-year development phase. We are proud of our country. As part of the festivities on the 25th anniversary of Independence we have highlighted Kazakhstan’s achievements and progress. They are well known and appreciated by the world community.
      Kazakhstan has become a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council since the beginning of 2017.
      "EXPO-2017" international exhibition will be held in Astana this year. We are the first among the CIS countries and Central Asia to hold such an important global event.
      Sports events within the Universiade-2017 have started in Almaty, with the participation of over 2,000 athletes and delegates from 57 countries.
      All that is the result of a correct political path and Kazakhstan’s high authority in the international arena.
      Kazakhstan shall join the world’s top 30 developed countries by 2050. We will surely go for this purpose.
      In conditions of growing competition and the lack of stability in the world relevance of my proposed Strategy-2050 to the people in 2012 is increasing. We have been able to timely anticipate the forthcoming hard time.
      Due to "Nurly Zhol" Economic Policy and "100 Specific Steps" Nation’s Plan we are worthily going through the initial stage of a complex global transformation. Additional KZT 1.7 trillion have been allocated to support the economy only during 2014-2016. That provided an opportunity for economic growth and business support, and creation of more than 200 thousand new jobs.
      The result ensured the gross domestic product growth by 1% in 2016. That is particularly important under the current difficult conditions.
      The world situation is changing rapidly. That is a new global reality, and we have to accept it.
       
      Only those nations, which manage to get ahead of the future and decisively meet the challenges, without standing and waiting, are the winners.
      The next and fourth industrial revolution starts in the world.
      Universal economic digitalization will lead to disappearance of entire industries and creation of fundamentally new ones. Great changes before our eyes are both a historic challenge and opportunity for the nation.
      Today I pose a challenge of carrying out the implementation of Kazakhstan’s third modernization. It is necessary to create a new model of economic growth that will provide the country's global competitiveness.
      Currently, many countries are trying to solve the same problem. I am sure that the transition recipes to the new growth model are not equal. We should have regard to our strong points and not to lose our opportunities that we have together created over 25 years of our Independence.
      We all remember the 1st modernization of Kazakhstan. We have a memory of starting our way a quarter century ago on the ruins of the Soviet Union. Then from the foundation our generation created a new state, which was not on the world map.
      There was a transition from a planned to a market economy. It is crucial for me that together we have then managed to hold the country from the turmoil of internal conflicts and economic collapse. Kazakhstan came out of that period with minimal losses and the largest acquisitions.
      The 2nd modernization began with adopting  the Strategy-2030 and creating a new capital city Astana. The results are undeniable. The country broke away from the economic crisis zone and joined the world’s 50 most competitive economies.
      Two successful modernization processes have given us invaluable experience. Now we need to boldly step forward and start the 3rd upgrade.
      This upgrade is not as plan of combatting the current global challenges, but a reliable bridge to the future, to fulfil the Strategy-2050 objectives. It will be held based on the "100 Specific Steps" Nation’s Plan.
      I see its five key priorities. They are designed to ensure the economic growth above the world average, and steady advance to the 30 leading countries.
       is the accelerated technological modernization of the economy.
      We should cultivate new industries, which are created involving the use of digital technologies. That is a far reaching complex task.
      It’s critical to cultivate such sunrise industries as 3D printing, online commerce, mobile banking, digital services, including health and education sectors, and others. These sectors have changed the economic structure of the developed countries and have given a new quality to senile industries.
      In this regard, I charge the Government to work out and adopt a separate program called "Digital Kazakhstan".
      It is necessary to fit our legislation to the new realities.
      It is also important to make provision for development of communications and ubiquitous access to a fiber-optic infrastructure. The digital industry development will provide impetus to all other sectors. Therefore, the issue of IT-sphere development should be kept under special control of the Cabinet.
      Factor of great significance in forming new industries is to support innovation and fast introduction into production.
      I entrust the Government with establishing the IT-startup International TechnoPark on the basis of one of EXPO-2017 facilities. It has to become a platform for attracting entrepreneurs and investors from around the world. That requires appropriate infrastructure and the enabling environment, including tax breaks, simplified visa and labor regimes.
      We also need to develop the research and innovative potential of universities based on Nazarbayev University and "Alatau" Innovation Park.
      The 2nd complex task. In parallel with creating new industries, we should give impetus to the development of traditional basic industries.
      They are industry, agriculture, transport and logistics, construction and other sectors.
      Firstly, it is important to boost productivity.
      The main factor here should be the widespread introduction of elements of the 4th industrial revolution. They are automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, exchange of "big data" and others.
      I entrust the Government, together with business, with working out a package of measures on technological re-equipment of basic industries until 2025.
      Secondly, there is a need to continue industrialization with emphasis on the development of competitive export industries in priority sectors.
      I entrust the Government with the task of increasing non-oil exports in half by 2025.
      To activate the work in this direction is necessary to concentrate the tools of development and promotion of exports in the same department. Exporters need to provide support for the principle of "single window", including in the regions.
      I entrust the Government with creating a Council for Export Policy. It should include the business community representatives.
      Prior to September 1 this year, the Government together with the akims and businesses need to develop a unified export strategy.
      Kazakhstan should keep the leading position in attracting foreign investment. "Astana" International Financial Center should play an important role in attracting financial resources in the country’s economy.
      It is critical to fit into global chains of production and distribution of goods and services. This should be done primarily by attracting multinational companies.
      It is necessary to effectively implement a joint investment program with China to establish production facilities in Kazakhstan. The agreements have been inked with the Chinese side. The facilities have been identified. We need to work specifically.
      That will be modern production with creation of about 20 thousand new jobs for Kazakhstan. For the present the actualization of six projects has started and two projects have already been launched. One of them is a plant for large-assembly of JAC hybrid and all-electric vehicles.
      I instruct to study the issue of further development of electric vehicle production with export orientation, making provision for the necessary infrastructure.
      In general, Kazakhstan should have its own investment strategy. The government should prepare it before September 1 of the current year.
      Protection and promotion of national economic interests in the framework of international cooperation shall be provided. This includes, before everything else, the activities within the EAEC, SCO, interfacing with the Economic Belt of the Silk Road. Economic diplomacy work shall be rebuilt and strengthened.
      Thirdly, the country’s mining and oil and metallurgical complex shall retain its strategic importance for the economic growth sustainability.
      In the context of global demand slowdown it is critical to enter new markets and expand the geography of supplies. Much attention shall be given to expanding the mineral resource base. Active exploration is necessary to be held.
      Further development of these industries should be strictly linked to the deepening of raw materials complex processing.
      I entrust the Government with ensuring the adoption of a new Code on Mineral Resources and making the necessary amendments to the tax legislation by the end of the year.
       *****
      Fourthly, the agricultural sector shall become the new driver of the economy.
      Kazakhstan’s agriculture has a promising future. Upon many items, we can be one of the world's largest manufacturers of agricultural exports, especially for organic food production. ‘Made in Kazakhstan’ brand shall become the standard of such products.
      At the same time we have to be a so-called "bread basket" for grain production for the entire Eurasian continent. A shift from primary production to the production of high-quality and processed products shall be provided. Only then will we be able to compete in international markets.
      In this regard, the Government and the governors are instructed the following:
      Firstly, the principles of allocation of subsidies and gradual move to production insurance shall be reconsidered;
      Secondly, during the 5 years all conditions for combining more than 500 thousand households and small farms into cooperatives shall be created;
      Thirdly, the level of product processing shall be increased, and the effective storage, transportation and distribution of goods shall be created;
      Fourthly, the level of productivity shall be increased and production costs shall be reduced;
      Fifthly, we must improve the efficiency of land use. Within 5 years, the area of ​​irrigated land shall grow by 40%, thereby raising it to 2 million hectares;
      Sixthly, investment in agricultural research shall boost, to be in demand in a business environment.
      I instruct to make provision for the export of food products increase by 40% by 2021 through the agricultural production diversification.
      These tasks should be fulfilled within the framework of the new agriculture development state program.
      *****
      Fifthly, the new Eurasian logistics infrastructure development is an important priority.
      Substantial investment has already been made. Now economic returns are necessary.
      I instruct the Government in 2020 to provide an increase in the annual volume of transit:
      - 7 times for goods, carried in containers - up to 2 million containers;
      - 4 times for passenger transport by air - up to 1.6 million passengers in transit.
      It is necessary to increase earnings from transit traffic by 5.5 times - up to $ 4 billion a year.
      In 2015, I initiated "Nurly Zhol" infrastructure development program. Over the past two years, the program has fully justified itself.
      During the current year 4,400 kilometers of roads of national importance will be covered by construction and reconstruction. Among them, no less than 600 kilometers with the staged at a fee implementation will be put in before the end of the year.
      Coordination with neighboring countries is critical to unlock the country’s transport and transit potential. It is necessary to ensure the goods transit freedom, creation and modernization of transport corridors. Particular attention should be paid to the transport infrastructure management, service level increase and elimination of administrative barriers.
      Due to the increasing traffic volume along the Trans-Caspian corridor it is necessary to proceed with the second phase of 
       port construction, a car way.
      Sixthly, urbanization processes necessitate the construction sector development. It shall become a full driver of the domestic economy.
      Remember that investing in construction of roads, buildings and other infrastructure we define the physical and technological shape of our cities for years to come. It is therefore important to ensure the transfer of the latest technologies both to the construction and manufacture of building materials. At present we have good opportunities to accomplish that
      By my instructions, "Nurly Zher" Housing Program realization begins since the current year. It addresses a critical goal - housing provision for 1.5 million households in the coming 15 years.
      The program includes comprehensive measures of housing market development. It is cheaper bank loans for constructors by providing grants through "Damu" JSC.  Subsidizing mortgage loans, issued by banks, for the population will take place through "Kazakhstan Mortgage Company" JSC. Construction of credit housing for 
       depositors by Akimats will continue. Previously allocated funds by a "revolving" principle will be reused for that purpose.
      For vulnerable social groups the Akimats will continue developing rental housing without the right of redemption. For mass housing the akims should allocate appropriate land plots.
      We will strive to ensure that the construction of individual houses in the cities is carried out in a single architectural style. With this aim in view the government will assist with the necessary infrastructure.
      The Government together with the akims shall take measures for developing transport links with the nearest large city settlements.
      The 3rd complex task is the labor market modernization.
      Human resources will become available with technology implementation in senile industries. However, creation and development of new industries should become an additional source of employment and real income growth.
      I instruct the Government and governors to create the conditions for a controlled flow of workers into other sectors.
      Our sizeable enterprises should, jointly with 
      , develop appropriate "road maps". They need to provide co-investment in retraining downsized workers and their further employment. We need to support the labor mobility processes from labor-surplus regions, and from rural to urban areas as well.
      The Government should reform the employment centers and create a single online platform for all vacancies and all settlements.
       is massive improvement and the business environment expansion.
      One of our strategic goals is ensuring the contribution of small and medium-sized businesses in GDP of at least 50% by 2050.
      It is an ambitious but achievable goal. To achieve it at that stage the following is needed.
      Firstly, by my instructions, since this year the Government has launched a program of effective employment and business activity growth.
      Now the citizens of Kazakhstan in rural regions and towns can get a microloan of up to KZT 16 million for business operations.
      It is meaningful to broaden the geography of micro-lending, actively using tools to guarantee and service support of entrepreneurs. These measures should be accompanied by organization of business training and financial literacy.
      It is necessary to further improve support tools for business activity. Each region of Kazakhstan has to offer complex measures to develop mass entrepreneurship, including family businesses.
      The number of created new jobs, as before, is one of the key criteria for assessing the effectiveness of the Government and akims’ activities.
      Secondly, the Government and "Atameken" National Chamber of Entrepreneurs shall  take measures on front end reduction of all kinds of costs for businesses. That especially refers to cost of services in the energy, transport and logistics, and utilities as well.
      Public services procedures should be optimized as much as possible. It is necessary to reduce the time and a list of documents and eliminate duplicate procedures. Thus it is necessary to change them over fully to electronic format, without physical presence.
      In addition, the existing regulatory burden on business is incompatible with the task of creating a new model of growth.
      I challenge the Government and akims to elaborate the action framework on business deregulation by July 1 of this year.
      It is necessary to implement the best standards and practices of developed countries. It is especially important to carry out this work at the regional level.
      Akims and the Government shall develop detailed plans to improve the conditions for doing business in the regions based on the World Bank ranking.
      Rating of regions and cities on the ease of doing business is critical to be introduced. We will institute a special award for the best. It shall be awarded once a year, on Industrialization Day.
      Thirdly, a reduction in the share of the state in the economy to 15% of GDP, up to OECD levels should give a new impetus to economic growth.
      Previously there was a list of about 800 enterprises for privatization until 2020. The work is in progress.
      The Government is assigned to speed up and complete the privatization of companies in this list until the end of 2018.
      There is also need of accelerating the preparation and output of our largest companies on the IPO. Introduction of Yellow Pages has reduced the types of activities for the state in the economy by 47% (from 652 to 346).
      The next stage is transfer to the private sector or elimination of all state-owned enterprises and organizations, which do not conform to these principles until 2020. And these are several thousand enterprises.
      The practice, when we created legal entities under each program or task, is meant to finish.
      It is critical to ensure privatization’s transparency and efficiency. There is also need of reconsidering the role of state holdings.
      The Government is tasked to provide a qualitative transformation of "Samruk-Kazyna" holding. It is necessary to conduct a thorough audit and optimization of both managerial and production business processes. As a result, it shall become a highly efficient, compact and professional. Management and corporate governance needs to get improved to the international level.
      It is necessary to clearly define what to leave for the state, in which important sectors and with what degree of participation.
      Natural monopolies and implementation of strategic projects, including with the participation of TNCs, shall be for the state to be left. These projects should give a multiplier effect.
      "Baiterek" and "KazAgro" are to be exposed to organizational change without fail. They must be operators on the implementation of government development programs. At the same time it is necessary to optimize their functions. All that can be done by the private sector is necessary to transfer to the business.
      They should also deal with the involvement of funding from non-state sources for program implementation.
      Fourthly, public-private partnership outspread is a strong potential for promotion of entrepreneurship. This refers to transfer of a number of government services to business.
      We already have good results on their involvement in preschool education. If during previous 3 years the state has built 189 kindergartens with 40 thousand places, the private sector has opened more than 1 300 per 100 thousand people. South Kazakhstan (397), Almaty (221), Kyzylorda (181) regions have opened more of private kindergartens.
      For me the PPP example in this sector is of fundamental importance. It shows how government and business together solve one of the most important national problems – to completely cover 3-6 year old children with pre-school education by 2020.
      The PPP growth depends on the akims’ specific and professional activities.
      All possible kinds and forms of PPP are critical to be used for utilization of private funds: trust management of state property, service contracts and otherы. Thus it is necessary to simplify and speed up all the negotiation procedure, particularly in relation to smaller projects.
      PPP is set to become a primary mechanism for infrastructure development, including the social one.
      To modernize housing and utility infrastructure it is critical to transfer it in trust or to PPP with feasible pending privatization. The government shall stop going rounds in circles. We need to become active in that process.
      Fifthly, it is important to prevent price and tariff fixing.
      The Government is assigned, together with "Atameken", to carry out "audit" of all legislation to identify regulations that hinder competition.
      The 3rd priority is macroeconomic stability.
      The key objective here is restoration of the monetary policy incentive role and  involvement of private capital in financing the economy.
      Firstly, at present the National Bank has an important task for inflation targeting regime development. It is necessary to achieve the phased reduction of inflation to 3-4% in the medium term.
      Secondly, the financial sector’s "reset" is necessary.
      The National Bank is assigned to work out a set of measures for the banking sector enhancement.
      It is necessary to step up activities for clearing the banks' balance sheets from the sub-prime loans and, if needed, to make provision for their follow-on capitalization by the shareholders. The National Bank needs to be given more rights for the state banks’ operational control. It must move from a formalized approach to a risk-based in order to take measures of influencing the banks, without waiting for technical infringement on their part.
      It is also necessary to strengthen the responsibility of audit companies, to ensure transparency and shareholders and, as a whole, to improve corporate governance. All that should be fixed in terms of legislation.
      With a focus on handling a problem of money stringency in the economy and high interest rates on loans the National Bank and the Government are assigned to take measures for ensuring availability of medium- and long-term funding in KZT.
      The National Bank shall be responsible not only for inflation but also for economic growth together with the Government.
      Thirdly, the stock market’s further development.
      Privatization should give impetus to its development. It is necessary to float "Samruk-Kazyna" Fund, as I have said before. Further increasing the opportunities for people to invest their savings primarily in various types of securities is critical.
      At the end of 2016 we completed the legalization process. More than 140 thousand citizens of our country have taken part in it. In total KZT 5.7 trillion have been legalized, including KZT 4.1 trillion in cash.
      The task of the Government is that these funds work in the economy, through participation in privatization as well. At the same time there is also a need to consider issues of subsidizing private bond issues of Kazakhstani enterprises.
      The Government, together with the National Bank, is assigned to take measures aimed at enhancing the domestic stock market.
      Another key challenge lies in bringing the fiscal policy to the new economic realities.
      Firstly, it is necessary to radically improve the efficiency of budget spending.
      We fully provided the national programs with the necessary resources in 2017. The ministries and departments shall check the use of funds’ effectiveness.
      The Ministries of Labour and Social Welfare, Health, Education and Science should be the first, as they account for over 40% of the national budget. The reports are to be presented upon the results.
      It is critical to reallocate funds from ineffective programs on the program, making provision for accomplishing the tasks of the 3
       Modernization. Besides, the budgetary procedures shall be simplified for faster and more effective bringing of the funds to the real economy.
      Fiscal decentralization policy is critical to be carried on. In previous years a large number of functions and powers have been delivered from the central to the local level. Now they need to back up sufficient financial autonomy. At the same time it is important to avoid concentration of spending authority at the regional level. It is necessary to pass them on to the district and village levels. Akims must decide the issues of regional and local importance, and the Government is to focus on the national issues.
      Secondly, it is essential to more efficiently deal with the National Fund.
      The size of the guaranteed transfer from the National Fund must be gradually reduced to KZT 2 trillion by 2020.
      Tax policy should focus on stimulating business exit from the "shadow" and the tax base expansion in the non-primary sector. Optimization of the existing tax incentives is critical. New special tax regimes shall be taken into consideration in a new angle on the eve of the universal declaration.
      Tax administration arrangements remain wanting. First of all, it concerns VAT.
      Thirdly, the government needs to build monitoring and control system for the external and internal loans of the quasi-public sector and bring it to order.
       *****
       is improvement of human capital in quality.
      Firstly, the role of the education system shall change. Our task lies in making education central to a new model of economic growth. Training programs should focus on the development of critical thinking abilities and skills of independent search for information.
      At the same time, IT-knowledge formation, financial literacy and education of youth patriotism shall be focused on. Reducing the gap in quality of education between urban and rural schools is critical.
      The Government is assigned to submit relevant proposals.
      Gradual transition to trilingual education.
      The Kazakh language retains its dominant position. Much attention shall be paid to its further development. Today, however, English is the language of new technologies, new industries and new economy. Currently, 90% of the world information is in English. Every two years its volume doubles. Kazakhstan cannot reach national progress without mastery of the English language.
      Since 2019 teaching in some subjects for the tenth- and eleventh-graders will be conducted in English. It is necessary to carefully consider this issue and take reasonable solution on it.
      Schools and teachers’ level in urban and rural areas differ greatly. Problem of competent teachers’ shortage is relevant. Therefore, considering all these aspects, introduction of the English language should be in a phased approach.
      Relevant proposals are to be submitted.
      "Free Vocational Education for All" Project implementation starts on my initiative since the current year.
      Free education, first of all, should cover unemployed and self-employed young people and people of working age who do not have professional education. It is necessary to give impetus to the development of vocational education system for training human resources for new productions within the marked economy.
      In pursuing these aims the professional standards’ upgrade in accordance with labor market requirements and best international experience of in-service training is essential.
      At the same time special attention shall be paid to the higher education system quality. It is necessary to enhance monitoring and requirements for the staff of higher education institutions, their level of business logistics and educational programs.
       *****
      Secondly, the health care system must change along with the educational system.
      From July 1 this year, a system of compulsory social health insurance starts to be implemented based on joint and several liabilities of the state, employers and citizens. This system’s effectiveness has been proven by the world’s practice.
      Participants in the health insurance system will be given a wide range of medical services. Participation of socially vulnerable groups in it will be supported by the government.
      The government needs to provide the health service informational support. Promotion of competition among private health institutions should be provided equal conditions within the CSHI (
      ) system.
      The Government and governors are assigned to conduct broad awareness-raising activities.
      It is also necessary to introduce medication price management legislation.
      Thirdly, the social security.
      Under my instructions, pensions for 2.1 million retirees will be increased by 20% compared to 2016 to July 1, 2017.
      In addition, the basic pension appointment will be based on the new methodology from July 1, 2018. Its size will depend on the length of participation in the pension system.
      All of these measures in 2018 will provide an increase of 1.8 times of the new basic pension size as compared to 2017.
      About 400 thousand children are annually born in the country, which is higher than the 1999 level by almost two times. This good trend should be backed up.
      Upon my instructions, the size of a lump sum birth benefit will increase by 20% from 1 July 2017.
      The living minimum wage shall be reviewed. It is supposed to accord with the actual consumer spending of Kazakhstan’s population. This will allow increasing for 3 million people the size of the basic pension benefits for people with disabilities and families without supporters, targeted assistance and benefits for disabled children to January 1, 2018.
      Starting January 1, 2018 the threshold has to raise for providing targeted social assistance from 40 to 50% of the subsistence minimum and implement its new format. At the same time all those who can work should be supported only on the condition of participation in the employment program.
       is the institutional transformation, security and anticorruption efforts.
      Firstly, as part of the 3rd Modernization the Government needs to ensure the work on implementing the best practices and the OECD recommendations.
      Secondly, we carry out reforms aimed at protecting private property, the rule of law and equality before the law. The activity needs to be continued.
      The Government, together with "Atameken" NCE (
      )  and civil society, are assigned to conduct an audit of all legislation to strengthen protection of property rights.
      The administrative and criminal law also needs to be humanized. Administrative fines should be fair and proportionate to the offense committed.
      It is necessary to carry out further work to reduce the penalties for offenses in the sphere of business. It is necessary to decriminalize economic compositions with a low degree of public danger.
      It is necessary to achieve greater confidence in the judicial system. It is important to avoid any undue influence on the work of judges.
      Thirdly, the security status becomes the measure of a strong and capable state.
      In modern conditions the humanity is faced with terrorism growth. The key here is the fight against financing the destructive forces and links with foreign terrorist organizations.
      It is critical to prevent religious extremism propaganda, including on the Internet and social networks. It is necessary to form a society of zero tolerance for any action related to radical manifestations, especially in the sphere of religious relations.
      The prisons should carry out organized purposeful activity of theological rehabilitation services to convicted persons. It is necessary to take additional steps to spiritual and moral education of the younger generation.
      Non-governmental sector and religious associations should be actively connected to that sort of activity.
      All these measures have to be taken into account in the worked out, on my behalf, State Program on combating religious extremism and terrorism for 2017-2020.
      Fight against cybercrime becomes more urgent.
      The Government and the National Security Committee are assigned to take action to create a "Cyber Shield of Kazakhstan" system.
      Fourthly, we have made significant steps to reduce the level of corruption in the country. At the same time, the main focus is on combating the effects of corruption.
      It is necessary to intensify efforts to identify and eliminate the causes of corruption and assumptions.
      One key issue is the procurement sector improvement.
      I instruct the Government to introduce a unified public procurement system on the principle of centralized services.
      The approaches for conducting procurement in the quasi-public sector, natural monopolies and subsoil sector also need to turn them around.
      Much in anticorruption efforts shall depend on the whole society’s active participation. With the social networks and other media resources growth the unified non-admission should be a powerful tool in combating corruption.
      By this Address I would like to convey to every citizen my view of development trends in the new reality.
      I instruct the Government to develop a strategic plan for development until 2025 for the country’s 3rd modernization titled “Kazakhstan’s National Technology Initiative".
      We have no other choice but meet the challenge gracefully and solve the problem for the country’s further modernization.
      I believe our great nation fully takes advantage of the unique historical chance.
      Kazakhstan is a new multi-ethnic, confident in its future, and dynamically developing country! We have passed the 25-year-old path of development. In the next 25 years we expect even higher frontiers.
      By accumulating a unique wealth of experience when creating a state, we have entered a new stage. I am sure that no matter what difficulties are ahead of us, we will overcome them. Our main strength is unity.
      We will turn Kazakhstan into a more prosperous country for our descendants!

      During the interview for the PrimeMinister.kz, Chairman of the Board of Kazakhstan Center for Modernization and Development of Housing and Public Utilities Nursultan Dzhienbayev told about the creation of property owners’ associations and the implementation of the unified information system E-Shanyraq.

      Dzhienbayev told about the reform planned in housing and communal services. So, according to him, the law on changing the housing cooperatives to the property owners’ associations is currently in Parliament and is discussed in the Committees.
      If the housing owners’ cooperatives in the current understanding manage the house within the apartments (cleaning of entrances, etc.), then the new form of a non-profit organization — the association of property owners — provides for an individual approach to the management of each house.
      “You have a house, you have shared ownership. Your property is not only an apartment; it is part of the roof, part of the basement, part of the house. Currently, some basements and roofs are used by the housing cooperatives, are leased, cellular antennas are installed, money is earned. But residents do not see any benefit from this. Somewhere they even overpay for water or electricity. Many violations occur. When they see that it is their common property, they will dispose of it together. The management company, using the money earned, will provide additional services, create some kind of benefits, build playgrounds, and make an additional payment for capital repairs. This will allow them to manage more effectively on a large scale,” said Dzhienbayev.
      Today, about 14.5 thousand housing cooperatives and management companies are registered in Kazakhstan. According to the chairman of JSC KazTsentr, this is a big number.
      “In order for management companies to become professional within the real sector of the economy, they must earn their trust. There should be no more than 300-500 of such companies. They will provide quality services and the people will trust them. It works this way all over the world. Apartment owners’ association is a very good management tool for the house itself. People should understand that not only the apartment is their area is of ​​responsibility, but the whole house,” Dzhienbayev noted.
      At the same time, he noted that the existing cooperatives should be transformed.
      “I think the most successful and powerful of them began this work long ago. I monitor this situation. There are wonderful examples in Karaganda when the cooperative has already transformed into a management company. Now it has more than 100 houses under management. All residents are happy, satisfied, there are no complaints. Progress has to go. We have to adapt to the new realities, the digital field. Digitalization is underway, new technologies are being applied,” Dzhienbayev said.
      Speaking about the launch of a single information system for housing and communal services, E-Shanyraq, Dzhienbayev said that today the system is operating in a pilot mode. Five thousand apartment buildings are connected to it. Digital passports have been established, but the population itself is not yet working in the system.
      According to the chairman, in the next month and a half, mobile applications will be available to the public. Today, personal offices of residents, subjects of natural monopolies, local executive bodies have already been created, data is being transferred from metering devices, analytics and big data are being collected, which tomorrow will be very valuable material for achieving a balance of energy production and consumption in the country.
      In the personal accounts of the mobile application, users will see electronic passports of houses, management companies, will be able to vote, control their current account, pay for services, and choose tariffs.
      According to Dzhienbayev, the greatest benefit of this system for Kazakhstanis is transparency. These are the correct charges for services, effective relationships with government agencies, and management companies. Intellectual system — data cannot be changed. If someone will fulfill their obligations in bad faith, this, according to the chairman of the board, will be recorded. In the future it will be possible to create lists of unfair participants in the housing and utilities sector.

      The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population is considering a number of possible formats for the application of borrowed labor in Kazakhstan. This was announced by the head of the department Tamara Duissenova during a briefing in the press center of the Government.

      "In general, I would like to note that the practice of borrowed labor is widely used in developed countries, but we need to understand how much we can implement it. There are three formats of extra work," said Duissenova.
      In the first case, the organization sends its employee to another company, while the latter is not responsible for protecting his rights. This format is unacceptable for Kazakhstan. The second format allows the sending of the employee from one legal entity to another, with all the conditions and mode of work being specified. This option is planned to be considered in more detail in order to assess how it is possible to implement it in Kazakhstan.
      In the third format, a private employment agency can send an employee, for example, to individuals. In this case, tripartite agreements will be concluded between the agency, the employee and the individual who takes it to work. This format of borrowed labor is considered the most favorable.
      "The working groups will work on these issues, and we will provide additional information on the results," T. Duissenova said.

      December 20 at the briefing in the press center of the Government, the Vice Minister of National Economy Serik Zhumangarin spoke about the work being done to increase the transparency of tariff setting and reduce tariffs for the population.

      Since 2015, on behalf of the Head of State, Kazakhstan has introduced a new policy of limiting long-term tariffs with a validity of five years or more. As a result, 1.02 trillion tenge of investments were attracted to the sphere, including 684 billion tenge in the housing and utilities sector, which are almost entirely (98%) financed from extrabudgetary sources.
      By 2021, according to Zhumangarin, about 2.2 trillion tenge is expected to be attracted to natural monopolies, including about 1.3 trillion tenge in the housing and utilities sector. According to the Ministry of Economic Development, previously no program has attracted a similar amount of funds.
      The measures taken made it possible for the first time not only to stop the deterioration of the communal infrastructure, but also to reduce it. Wear from 66% fell to 64.9%. Regulatory and technical losses were reduced.
      “This policy has fully justified itself. Naturally, we, as the authorized body, are responsible for the further implementation of this policy and we must not allow the subjects to lose this tempo. Therefore, this work (reduction of tariffs for utilities), which we have carried out during these months, will in no way lead to losses of natural monopolies,” Vice Minister Zhumangarin assured.
      According to the information sounded by the vice minister, as a result of unscheduled inspections, public reception rooms and other work organized to fulfill the instructions of the Head of State at the Security Council Nov. 7, 2018, internal reserves were found. In addition, Zhumangarin noted that some natural monopolies have shown their social responsibility. For example, KazTransGas Aimak JSC voluntarily reduced prices in most of its branches for gas transmission to consumers. Coupled with the fact that the Ministry of Energy has reduced wholesale gas prices, the final price for gas supply has decreased by 40%.
      At the same time, the vice minister stressed that the most important thing in this matter is the quality of the services provided.
      “In the new Law ‘On Natural Monopolies,’ we are introducing the concept of ‘incentive pricing method’ for the first time. That is, the tariff and the disposable profit will be tied to the indicators of quality, reliability and efficiency. The subject will himself declare at the beginning of the application period what indicators of quality and reliability he plans to achieve in percentage terms. It will be tied to a certain profit in millions of tenge. In case of failure, the tariff will decrease, and it will decrease further, taking into account the refinancing rate of the National Bank. That is, the monopoly will lose,” said the vice minister.
      Zhumangarin reminded that in case of violation by the natural monopoly entities of their obligations, consumers can apply to the authorized bodies with a corresponding statement.

      Urbanization will increase the country's competitiveness in the global space. Advisor to Director General of JSC "Kazakh Institute of Oil and Gas", a member of the Expert Council under the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan Zhaksybek Kulekeyev shared this view with Primeminister.kz.

      Industrial and innovative development path chosen by Kazakhstan will inevitably lead to the acceleration of urbanization processes, the rapid growth of urban population of the country at the expense of the active migration of rural population to the cities in the near future. This natural process will be accompanied by an increase in labor productivity, as much of the urbanized rural areas get jobs at the enterprises of the industrial sector, where productivity is traditionally higher than in the agricultural enterprises. Thus, according to Zh.Kulekeyev, urbanization will increase the country's competitiveness in the global space.
      Most of the cities of Kazakhstan were formed in the Soviet period as a result of industrialization and the discovery and development of mineral deposits. The number of cities in Kazakhstan increased from 19 to 82 from 1920 to 1983, which led to a sharp increase in the proportion of urban residents. However, a fact extremely low rate of urbanization has become characteristic of the country over the 25 years of Kazakhstan's independence; the proportion of rural residents (43%) is still maintained at a high level. It should be noted that the urban population was reduced in the period from 1993 to 2013, and there has been even reverse migration from cities to villages in some years.
      According to Zh.Kulekeyev, this process has been associated with the open economic policy carried out in the country since the first days of independence, resulting in many manufacturing industries, located mainly in the southern regions of the country, unable to withstand the competition, were forced to either reduce production or completely stop its production. As a result of these circumstances, people who lost their jobs in the cities began to move en masse to the countryside, swelling the ranks of the self-employed.
      The turning point was reached in 2013, beginning this year a steady growth of the urban population in Kazakhstan is observed. According to the expert, the implementation of the State program of industrial-innovative development played the positive role, as the number of employed people in the industry over the years of implementation of the program has increased by about 150 thousand people, and those employed in agriculture decreased by 900 thousand.
      The government is planning to increase the share of urban population to 70% in 2030  (currently 53%). According to the expert there are objective prerequisites for that.
      Currently, the second five-year industrialization program is implemented in the country, the course of implementation inspires optimism. For example, in the first year of implementation of the Programme of tools of SPIID created almost 34,000 new permanent jobs, most of which relate to the manufacturing industry. The second sector, which attracts a large number of workers, it  is trade and consumer services.
      "Today, trading companies are based in large cities, catering and consumer services that create new jobs, albeit with low pay. These sectors have also become attractive for rural youth, the number of employed in the agricultural sector was sharply reduced, especially pleases reduction in its share of the self-employed, " Zh.Kulekeyev said.
      In his Address "Third Modernization of Kazakhstan: global competitiveness" the President Nursultan Nazarbayev has set serious tasks before the Government to ensure new economic growth model. At the same time, the President stressed the need for the economy on the innovation track, focused on the most advanced digital technologies, and demanded the creation of the best conditions for business development. According to the expert, in the context of growing international competition for sustainable economic growth and social development is possible only when the country will create better conditions for capacity building of human capital, as well as for their effective use.
      "Therefore, we need to constantly work on improving the quality of human capital, raising educational levels, qualifications, job skills, tempering capacity for entrepreneurship, as well as providing space and freedom of initiative people of the country to implement their own ideas into practice," a member of the Expert Council said.
      He also emphasized the importance of supporting the initiative, enterprising people, because in this age of dynamic change it is impossible to succeed, forcing people business ideas above. If the necessary conditions are created, the educated, enterprising, adventurous people will lead the country to new heights, he said.
      A great attention to research urbanization processes is paid in the world. For what? It's simple, says Zh.Kulekeyev.
      "The best conditions for productive labor, and human habitation: advanced education, better health facilities, comfortable accommodations with all the comforts, as well as the availability of a wide range of services contributes to building human capital are created in the cities. Overall, this will improve both the living conditions of the population and improve the competitiveness of the country," he said.
      In addition, it is no news that the contents scattered over a vast territory of Kazakhstan population costs the state very expensive, because it is necessary to build roads, water supply system and other infrastructure, schools and hospitals in each village. Of course, the optimal distribution of the population across the country would have saved much of the state budget, to which, according to Zh. Kulekeyev, you must seek the realities of the present.
      Considering the process of urbanization, we can not say about the other side of the issue. People, who move from rural to urban areas, do not have a lot of money, and the opportunity to immediately find decent jobs they have. In this regard, the Head of State did not accidentally spoke about the need to reduce the cost of housing by the use of new building materials and technologies.
      "In order to reduce the cost of housing, we need to set up production of cheap building materials, using new technologies. Only the use of new technologies and more efficient equipment reduces the cost as building materials, as well as the final object," the expert believes.
      The expert believes that urbanization can not be regarded as a panacea for solving all the problems of our society. This is a natural process that will inevitably be characterized for Kazakhstan in the near future. Therefore, it is not recommended to artificially provoke people moving from rural areas to cities. On the vast territory of Kazakhstan there are many beautiful towns and good places whose residents may contribute to the development of the economy, organizing agribusiness. Therefore, along with the sustained development of the industrial sector to the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, it is necessary to constantly take care of the development of agriculture and the improvement of living standards of rural workers.

      A high level of imple­mentation of the targ­et indicators for 201­6 was recorded based ­on the results of mon­itoring the implement­ation of "Densaulyk" ­State Healthcare Deve­lopment Program for 2­016-2019," said Minis­ter of National Econo­my of the Republic of­ Kazakhstan T. Suleim­enov during the meeti­ng of the Government ­of Kazakhstan.

      T. Suleimenov noted t­hat three target indi­cators are provided i­n total under the Pro­gram; following the r­esults of 2016 all in­termediate values ​​w­ere achieved. 3 indic­ators were not implem­ented out of t 36 out­come indicators: mate­rnal mortality, 5-yea­r survival of patient­s with malignant neop­lasms and the number ­of adherent populatio­ns.
      In general, the preli­minary monitoring sho­wed the effectiveness­ of the Program, as e­videnced by the impro­vement of the basic m­edical and demographi­c indicators in the c­ountry, such as life ­expectancy; the healt­h index of the popula­tion and the level of­ people's satisfactio­n with the quality of­ medical care.
      There are issues that­ require additional a­ttention. For example­, the potential of th­e health sector has n­ot fully realized as ­a service sector.
      The country has a num­ber of large medical ­centers equipped with­ modern medical equip­ment. The highly spec­ialized medical assis­tance is actively dev­eloping; unique opera­tions are being carri­ed out, which the cit­izens of Kazakhstan u­sed to do abroad.
      Also, according to pr­eliminary data for 20­16, there is an incre­ase in private invest­ment in health sector­. Healthcare as a par­t of GDP also showed ­a positive trend, now­ this figure is 1.9%.­ However, these figur­es are more than 7% i­n such countries as I­srael and Korea.
      Thus, the domestic he­alth sector has a bac­klog to become a sect­or that can increase ­the GDP index. Theref­ore, it is advisable ­to provide additional­ measures in the Prog­ram for its further d­evelopment, including­ measures to attract ­leading foreign clini­cs, especially from c­ountries popular amon­g medical tourists to­ joint management of ­Kazakhstani clinics, ­or consider transferr­ing them to trust man­agement.

       "According to the Road Map and employment in general  a lot of work is carried out by the Government, more financial resources are being allocated. The only question is about the impact and the effectiveness. Issuance of microcredit is very important, it stimulates economic activity of the population, and here it is necessary that local authorities pay special attention to the efficient use of these funds, and focus  will be on the amount of development, but the final results, "  Nazarbayeva said.
      She also noted that part of the proceeds from all programs to promote employment and the stabilization of the labor market should be returned in the form of taxes and social contributions should increase trade and purchasing activity of the population.
      "There are no clear statistics on this matter,  to date we do not have. There probably should be relationships between the Ministry and  administrations which would meet the problem of efficiency of development of the money. Well, as in all these projects, infrastructure repair, for issuing microcredits  full transparency is needed in order to replace infrastructure projects on the Internet," she concluded.

      Chairman of the Committee on Sports and Physical Culture of the Ministry of Culture and Sports Serik Zharasbayev spoke about this in an exclusive interview with PrimeMinister.kz. So, the fundamental three sports are swimming, gymnastics, athletics.

      According to the ministry, such sports are the basis for improving the natural physical abilities of the child. These are such needs as the ability to run, swim and perform movements for good coordination, etc. After 2-3 years of specialization, the child can already express her wishes. As a rule, children who begin to engage in one sport then go to another sport.
      “There is a certain mentality, when parents choosing a sport, for some reason immediately say: ‘I want my child to be able to stand up for herself.’ In order for a child to stand up for herself, she should not immediately go to boxing — there is no need for that. If she participates in any sport, then sport as a rule disciplines, forms a strong character and will. Any athlete, football player, swimmer, having all these qualities, can calmly position himself no worse than a boxer or a wrestler,” said Zharasbayev.
      At the same time, the committee chairman admitted that when he is asked where to send the child, he advises winter sports like cross-country skiing, biathlon, figure skating, speed skating, short track.
      “These sports are at a new stage of development. We have built a huge number of buildings for this, pay them attention. Please, go there,” noted Zharasbayev.
      During the interview, the speaker also summed up the results of the sports year and announced major events scheduled before the end of the year. So, 2018 began with a significant event — in February, the Winter Olympic Games were held in Korea.
      “We performed decently, no worse than at the previous Olympics. Our athlete Galysheva Yulia won the bronze medal,” recalls Zharasbayev. Also in 2018, the Paralympic Winter Games were held, where for the first time in the history of Kazakhstan, the athlete Alexander Kolyadin won the Paralympic gold medal.
      Along with this, in the framework of the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the capital of Kazakhstan, major sporting events were held in 2018. For example, for the first time in the CIS, the World Triathlon Cup was held. The competition was attended by athletes from more than 80 countries.
      According to Zharasbayev, 2019 is yet to be intense: by the order of the Minister of Culture and Sports, more than 40 international competitions were approved to be held in our country.
      So, in March, the moguls World Cup will be held at the Chimbulak ski resort. In April, a major event is scheduled to take place at Barys Arena — the Ice Hockey Championship. Also, Kazakhstan was again given the right to host the World Triathlon Cup. In addition, the planned IRONMAN Astana Marathon. In September, the licensed World Championships will be held in three types of wrestling — Greco-Roman, freestyle, and women's. There will also be a World Para-Powerlifting Championship. The year is scheduled to end with another grand event — the World Kyokushin Karate Championship. Participation of more than 60 countries is planned. The Championship will be held under the auspices of a newly created organization in late 2019 — the Association of Martial Arts of Kazakhstan.

      In order to stay abreast of developed countries, our society must be open, not closed in its archaic structures and outlook, not standing still. It needs to get rid of mental characteristics, arrogance and showiness. Such an opinion was shared by the Director of the Institute of Eurasian Integration Gani Nygymetov with PrimeMinister.kz on the sidelines of the International Scientific and Practical Conference "Modernization 3.0: Ruhani Zhangyru".

      Gani Nygymetov noted that the Program article "Bolashakka Bagdar: Rukhani Zhangyru" of Nursultan Nazarbayev is worldview and is designed for several generations ahead. Because changing thinking, consciousness is a matter not of one day and not one year. It takes a whole generation to change.
      In addition, the expert believes that this modernization of public consciousness is one of the largest of those announced in modern Kazakhstan. And if a large part, namely 82% of Kazakhstanis understands and is ready for change, the remaining part does not understand how to implement them.
      "It is important for the population to understand that it is necessary to start with yourself. Not only the state apparatus or power institutions should be modernized. Our thinking, mentality should be modernized. Our society must understand that everything is in our hands. If we want good changes in life, we need to start today. The article is about this," said G. Nygymetov.
      At the same time, the society, according to the expert, should be open and mobile without mental characteristics and arrogance.
      "Today, modern youth goes abroad, studies, and sees what is happening in society. This is the kind of population that we need.
      It should be open, not closed in its archaic structures, in its outlook, not standing still. It should move towards the developed countries. And what's stopping us? We are hampered by our habits, qualities, mental characteristics. Without changing them, we will not be able to keep abreast of the developed countries. We like holding great tois, showiness and arrogance. There is also a group of people whose religious views do not correspond to progressive thinking. All this slows us down. We must get rid of this. We must get education, develop, move forward," he said.
      At the same time, he noted that the Institute of Eurasian Integration is currently studying the mood and values ​​of modern society, exploring the factors that impede modernization.
      "We are trying to listen to the population, we want to understand what bothers people. We conduct various opinion polls. All this in the form of recommendations we plan to convey to the Administration of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan and other state bodies. We want our state bodies to make informed decisions so that the authorities clearly feel what the public wants. We will be a channel of communication between society and the authorities," the expert explained.

      Today, at the press conference in the Government, the AIFC Governor Kairat Kelimbetov spoke about the prospects of the financial center, as well as the date of official presentation of the AIFC to the global investment community.

      "If the official birth of the center took place on January 1 and the beginning of the work of all its structures, then the inauguration ceremony, or 'tusaukeser rasimi' will be held on July 5. During his trip to the USA and in his video address to the participants of the international economic forum in Davos, the Head of State invited the members of the international financial and investment community to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the AIFC on 4-5 July, within the framework of the Astana Finance Days conference,” AIFC Governor Kairat Kelimbetov said.
      According to Kairat Kelimbetov, it is very symbolic that the broad opportunities of the Astana financial center will be presented to the world investment and financial elite in the framework of the three-day conference Astana Finance Days.
      In general, up to 20 companies submitted their applications for registration under the AIFC legislation. It is planned to increase this amount by 5-10 times by the end of the year. Before the end of the year, the AIFC should reach its full projected capacity: all the institutions will already be involved, tested and certified, and many companies will begin their full-scale activities as part of the registration in the AIFC.
      Kairat Kelimbetov also expressed confidence that within 15-20 years, the AIFC will enter the top 30 global financial centers, within 10 years — 20 Asian financial centers. At the same time, the first 3-5 years will be spent on reaching the designed capacity.
      Regarding the budget, Kairat Kelimbetov noted that the AIFC stock exchange plans to achieve self-sufficiency within 3-5 years.
      "As well as the world's leading financial centers created recently, such as Dubai Abu Dhabi, we plan for 3-5 years not to depend on budget injections too much, but depend on the possibility of attracting investments. We plan that due to the work of the AIFC in the next 3-5 years, from $3 to $5 billion will be attracted. This is our pessimistic assessment," the AIFC Governor said.
      In conclusion, Kairat Kelimbetov noted that in general within 10 years, $ 40billion will be attracted to Kazakhstan through the AIFC institutes.

      Jan. 23 at the opening ceremony of the Year of Youth the Head of State Nursultan Nazarbayev instructed to create a Youth Startups Support Fund. The decision was supported by youth representatives. A 12th grade student of Nazarbayev Intellectual School in Almaty Ivan Krepak says that creating a special Startup Support Fund is a great motivation for young people to work for the well-being of the country, create startups, learn and share knowledge.

      Being a student of the 12th grage at the NIS of physics and mathematics direction in Almaty, Ivan Krepak is a programmer, robotics and IT security specialist. Ivan created the first smart lock in Kazakhstan, — “bLock,” and also developed the “Zharys” mobile app, which aims to increase the participation of young people in various competitions. He is also the developer of the “Qiianat Etpe” Antiterrorist Antenna project and the author of the “VoiceKomek” mobile app, which allows people with hearing and speech impairments to communicate with people who do not speak sign language.
      “Today, in all international competitions and contests, our country is represented by students of intellectual schools. I made sure that our guys are internationally competitive. Our country has a powerful educational potential. The state is doing a lot so that today the atmosphere of the cult of knowledge reigned here, and young people had the opportunity to learn and create. But in order to make it, as Nursultan Nazarbayev says, ‘not to fall behind,’ we must raise competent, competitive and advanced youth. I sincerely believe that Jeff Bezos with Amazon, his company Uber and his Internet giant Alibaba, can be reised in our country,” said Ivan Krepak.
      Krepak believes that the most breakthrough and large-scale ideas, discoveries that will be used not only by the country, but also by the whole world, occur precisely at a young age. Young people are easier to deal with problems, easier to take on complex tasks. The youth generates bold ideas, is not afraid to implement them. The youth is not afraid of failures.
      “All successful startups do not work right away on the first attempt, successful startups are the result of experience gained from previous failed attempts. Before launching the Zharys, I developed many other mobile applications. Some of them were unpopular, there was flaw design, somewhere I lacked experience, but when I started participating in competitions, IT hackathons and other school disciplines, I realized that only Internet is not enough for me, I should go out in people, consult with professionals. Then I found like-minded people. I am glad that the Head of State decided to create a special fund to support start-ups,” the young inventor shared his opinion.
      He also expressed confidence that the Year of Youth will allow the younger generation to expand the boundaries of their knowledge and skills in the educational environment, the development of information technology, business and other sectors of the economy and society.
      “The Year of Youth is a new era for Kazakhstan. This can be called rebranding. Today, Kazakhstan in many ways overtakes not only the CIS, but also the USA, Canada, Japan, China,” Krepak noted.

      Vice Minister of the Interior Yury Ilyin spoke at the press-conference in the Government’s press center on the preparation of public services for the spring flood period.

      Ilyin said that more than 700 protective dams were purchased from the Government’s reserves and distributed across regions in 2018.
      “We don’t have to say that we can put motor pumps in every yard, but in order to properly prepare the population for floods, it is necessary to build the correct work of akimats together with the population. Now we are seeing that many residents are simply waiting for the services of public utilities, instead of themselves starting to prepare their yard for the looming threat,” said Ilyin.
      According to the vice minister, there are concerns about several regions of Kazakhstan, where the amount of snow reserves exceeds the norm. These are the West Kazakhstan, Karaganda, Akmola and East Kazakhstan regions. Excess snow in some areas is more than 100% of the annual norm. At the same time, there are both regional and interstate agreements in the issue of interaction, for example, the West Kazakhstan region with the Russian Federation, where services exchange information on water accumulation.
      “In critical situations, when there is a threat, expenses will be raised, the akimats should work to identify people living in water protection zones in order to resettle them in advance and ensure safety, which is done in Uralsk in particular. We annually carried out and will continue to carry out the evacuation of the population to temporary places of accommodation in order first of all to secure their lives. As for the property, then if it is insured, insurance companies will pay, and if these are low-income families, it is possible at the expense of the akimat’s reserves,” said Ilyin.
      It is worth noting that the roadmap has been implemented to prevent and eliminate flood threats from 2017 and it contains more than 600 measures to protect human settlements from flooding.

      Prime Minister of the Republic of Kazakhstan Bakytzhan Sagintayev addressed at the meeting of the Eurasian intergovernmental council in an "expanded" format in Bishkek today.

      Bishkek, March 7, 2017
      EEU  has already taken place as an effective integration association for more than two years. But these years were not easy for our countries. The instability of global financial and commodity markets affects the influence of external factors. In this connection, the GDP of the Union declined by 0.7%. Our mutual turnover declined by 11%.
      In such a period, it is important to consolidate the common efforts to strengthen cooperation, the formation of new effective tools for increasing trade between our countries.
      The key direction in this activity is the removal of barriers and restrictions. This work must be done systematically and in stages. The Commission and experts of the states have already done significant work in this direction. A register of more than 60 barriers and restrictions has been agreed. In the future, Roadmaps for their elimination will be developed. This will greatly simplify access for our enterprises to the general markets, as well as create additional conditions for their development.
      Another element of strengthening cooperation in the Union is the creation of the best conditions for manufacturers and businesses of our states. This was stated by the President of Kyrgyzstan A. Atambayev in his address to the Heads of our countries.
      Entrepreneurs of EEU expect a great positive effect from integration, creating common markets. Therefore, it is very important to achieve a quality, effective and easy-to-apply regulatory practice in those areas where we agreed to implement single regulation, the so-called "general rules of the game."
      In this regard, the business of our countries expects the early adoption of the Customs Code, which includes provisions on simplification of customs procedures, electronic declaration with shifting emphasis on post-customs control. We hope that in the near future the Code will be signed by all countries and by the end of this year will come into force.
      At the same time, we are interested in a joint solution of a set of issues arising in the field of customs clearance. Thus, according to the estimates of the customs services, possible risks of insufficient level of customs administration are noted in the case of the flow of Chinese goods by transit to the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic. This is evidenced, inter alia, by the growth of transit traffic from China by road in 2016, by 9.5 times.
      The system approach, in our opinion, should also be considered when considering initiatives for the development of the digital agenda of the Eurasian Economic Community. Undoubtedly, our systems should be able to interface with each other. This will effectively implement mechanisms to exclude administrative obstacles, create a reserve for the development of the new economy. At the same time, the issues of the digital agenda should be carefully considered. Do not allow the blocking of the implementation of national programs in this area.
      The launch of new projects, of course, must be accompanied by effective work to provide favorable conditions for access to foreign markets. In this connection, the implementation of the EurAsEC international agenda is of great importance. Negotiations on concluding trade and economic agreements with a number of states have now been intensified. At various levels of preparedness, there are issues of cooperation with the PRC, India, Iran, Serbia, Israel, Mongolia, Singapore.
      Despite the pace of negotiations, the requests of our industries and enterprises should be met. This will become the basis for the implementation of export potential and attracting investments in the economies of the countries of the Eurasian Economic Community.
      We believe that the dynamic and progressive development of each of our countries is important for the success of our integration association. Therefore, we reaffirm our intention to support the Kyrgyz Republic in adapting to the conditions of the EurAsEC. In December we signed the Agreement and the Protocol on the allocation of appropriate assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic.
      In addition, we also signed an Agreement on the early provision of a unified railway tariff for the transport of goods through Kazakhstan. It came into force in January this year. According to experts, early application of the provisions of the Agreement will allow Kyrgyz shippers to save about 60 million dollars.
      The list of goods allowed to move from Kyrgyzstan to Russia through Kazakhstan for 86 additional groups of goods was expanded since January 1 this year.

      Today every country in the world is seeking full digitalization, considering it as a transition to a faster management model, said Denis Stupin, a member of the Expert Council under the State Duma, a representative of the Center for Digitalization of the Economy.

      "If you take Russia, Kazakhstan, the CIS or the majority of other countries, you shouldn’t forget that this is not a fast process. There is not enough education for a quick transition. Against this background, there is an outflow of population from single-industry cities to central cities. As a result, there is a skew: large cities are crowded, and the standard of living in single-industry towns remains low," the expert said.
      In addition, according to him, low level of education is typical for these cities. Today, specialists in the field of digitalization, modern technologies are located in the central cities. In monocities, in general, there is no program to improve the qualifications of the teachers themselves, if we consider the problem from the position of digitalization.
      "In my opinion, first of all, it is necessary to raise the educational level of both public servants and university professors. Only by introducing this educational program, we will clearly indicate the terms of its implementation," D. Stupin said.
      Another important issue was touched upon by the Head of Kazakhstan in his speech — overpopulation of the planet. It should be noted that today the population of the planet is growing at a rapid pace. The main issue for the government is unemployment.
      "At the same time, when passing from a traditional to a digital economy, the state can suffer serious damage. What is the reason for this? New blockchain technologies, undoubtedly, allow solving many problems. But they just as much affect the development process. If we turn to blockchain technologies and at the same time choose the direction incorrectly, this can become the most dangerous direction in the development of mankind," the expert said.
      According to him, today we understand that in the near future the digital economy will increasingly replace people working offline. People will be creators and will receive some reward for their actions.
      "A lot of people are talking about unemployment today. In my opinion, it will not happen by itself. As the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan say, if a person wants to live well, he will always find a place. I am fully convinced and support this.
      The President of Kazakhstan announced the main directions, to which every state that wants to succeed, aspires," added D. Stupin.

      The Chairman of the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs "Atameken", Ablai Myrzakhmetov, during the Government session of Kazakhstan, announced a number of measures to improve the availability of credit for small and medium-sized businesses.

      According to A. Myrzakhmetov, lending levels after the recession in the first quarter of this year, are now once again demonstrating gradual growth. This is connected, first of all, with the adjustments of value of the Tenge. Against the background of the unstable dynamics of legal entity loans, SME loans have been steadily growing. The growth of SME loans was 47.7% in July 2016 compared to July 2015. Such results were achieved due to significant government support, the speaker noted. The Chairman of the National
      Chamber of Entrepreneurs identified a number of measures which, according to entrepreneurs, would make loans more affordable for businesses.
      In order to support the programs of the Business Roadmap-2020, a floating rate subsidy, depending on the base rate of the National Bank of Kazakhstan, was proposed. This measure will lead to the fact, that a lower base rate will increase the availability of liquidity for businesses. In addition, a proposal was made to introduce a mechanism for subsidizing the coupon, which will help create equal conditions for all kinds of financing business sources and allow entrepreneurs to independently determine ways to attract funding. Also, a proposal was made to review the concept of the "effectiveness of projects" under the "Business Roadmap-2020", as it is difficult for borrowers to meet growth standards in all indicators of economic activity.
      Moreover, he announced a proposal to resume the so-called "rehabilitation program" for large business entities, since the successful functioning of SMEs, engaged in service or contract work for large enterprises, directly depends on the state of large businesses.

      The budget will be supplemented by additional economic activity, broadening the tax base and optimization of benefits, Minister of National Economy Timur Suleymenov said at a press conference after a meeting of the Government.

      T. Suleymenov said that a new National Fund management concept was adopted in late 2016, which aims to reduce the transfer size from 2.8 trillion tenge to 2 trillion tenge in 2020. At the beginning of next year, a gradual decrease of the transfer will be incorporated in a three-year budget.
      Responding to a question, how will the missing funding draw, T. Suleimenov said that the main source of replenishment of the budget should be more economic activity, which will be created by a large number of government programs.
      In this regard, it is important to broaden the tax base. According to the minister, the tax base will be optimized due to the expansion of business activity.
      "GDP growth implies the emergence of new economic operators. Accordingly, they are all taxpayers, and we will draw the money due to the appearance of their economic activity, but not by raising taxes in any case," the head of Ministry of National Economy said.
      Another source of replenishment is the optimization of benefits. However, according to the minister, it does not mean their complete abolition.
      "This means that those privileges are used inefficiently, which exhausted its usefulness in terms of the need for society and the state, will be eliminated," T. Suleymenov said.
      In conclusion, the Minister of National Economy stressed that the reduction in transfers from the National Fund will have no effect on the fulfillment of social obligations of the state. Further work will be undertaken to improve tax administration.

It was also noted that the opening of a transport and logistics center will assist in solving the rising problems in the region and increase the competitiveness of domestic products.

To solve the problems of the processing enterprises, the Prime Minister instructed the Ministry of Agriculture, in cooperation with the relative government agencies, to collect the suggestions of entrepreneurs and submit them to the Government for consideration.

      In the course of Government meeting, Minister of National Economy Kuandyk Bishimbayev reported on measures to curb the growth of socially important goods prices.

      "Ministry of National Economy analyzed the balance of the markets, as a result of which a number of reasons that influence the growth of socially important goods in the domestic market were revealed. The first factor is the change of price situation on the world markets and the weakening of the national currency impacted on products that are dependent on imports, the provision of domestic goods consumption is less than 60%," K. Bishimbayev said.
      The second reason is the increase of tariffs for natural monopolies’ services and prices for petroleum products in the current year.
      "The third is the impact of seasonal fluctuations. The prices for certain types of goods are increasing every year due to the reduction of stocks in the warehouses. This is primarily vegetables: potatoes, carrots, onions, cabbage and red beet. Usually, the prices reach its maximum in May-August. Fourth is the effect of exports. In view of the functioning of the Eurasian Economic Union and transparency of customs borders, in particular with Russia and Kyrgyzstan, an outflow of goods and price increase in domestic market occurs in case of price increase for cross-border markets. To date, these factors have had an impact on price growth, and we expect that significant growth will not happen by the end of the year," K. Bishimbayev said.
      The Minister noted that there are tools for controlling the growth of food prices, in particular holding of commodity interventions from the stocks of Regional Stabilization Funds.
      Analysis of the stabilization funds for the period 2015-2016 showed that their potential is not involved at the appropriate level. The Minister noted that the sharp jump in prices is typical for regions with low levels of food stocks.
      In addition, K. Bishimbayev stopped at the unfairness of the market entities.
      "The situations where trade margins exceeded more than 200% were revealed. Ministry is to prevent unjustified rise in prices for socially important goods. Since the beginning of this year, Antitrust Authority initiated 27 investigations, 12 of them were completed and 15 are under investigations. On the results of investigations, the total amount put up by the antimonopoly body of material sanctions, taking into account the monopoly revenue amounted to about 23 million tenge, the state budget received about 12 million tenge,"  K. Bishimbayev said.

      "Indeed, the new economic reality requires modern and flexible approaches to the implementation of future policies of economic development and welfare of the citizens. During the period of high prices of resources has been a solid basis to overcome the difficulties, to ensure the stability and sure to continue further development," S.Madiyev said.
      According to him, the goal remains the same - to enter 30 most developed countries; the country's economy should grow faster pace relative to other countries. In this competition, especially in foreign markets, only amplified, countries are active and adaptive approach to solving problems in the ever-changing conditions.
      Chairman said that, if we look at new strategies for the most dynamically developing countries, common areas can be clearly identified; special attention is given to them. Firstly, almost all countries have focused on the development of quality human capital, and secondly, elements of technological breakthroughs and scientific research in virtually all fields of activity, ranging from governance, finishing small and medium-sized businesses, are widely introduced. Particular attention is paid to attracting direct, long-term foreign investment with simultaneous operation in the fight for export markets.
      "It is gratifying to see that the tasks and goals for the near future in Kazakhstan is very well capture, current trends in the world, at the same time take into account internal factors specific to our country," the head of the Institute said.
      With regard to the activities of the Institute for Economic Research, then, according to Chairman of the Board, the organization has actively started to realize the objectives set in the Message. The plans are to play a role in providing clear and application information for the Government in general and the Ministry of National Economy in particular. All is on the basis of precise calculations and global best practices. The Institute believes that it will take a very high-quality economic decisions on the basis of applied calculations, advanced analysis and opinions of a wide pool of international and local experts.
      Plans for research for the current year were revised for this; we formed the design group and have already started the implementation of new tasks.
      In order to radically improve the business environment, the Institute in cooperation with the Ministry of National Economy and SPE will focus efforts on a deep analysis of the business environment and making recommendations to the new conditions of the economy.

      In addition, it is planned to develop a set of measures to reduce business costs and conduct a full-scale "audit" legislation to eliminate legal barriers to the development of competition. This will reveal what kind of load is carried by business today and to develop proposals for the adoption of appropriate decisions.
      "We plan to lay system basis for monitoring and measurement of successful achievements in the field of entrepreneurship across the regions. A local method of ranking on the ease of doing business, which is understandable and accessible, will be developed for this purpose," said chairman about the planned innovations.
      In the future, ranking of the regions on the ease of doing business will be formed using this method. It is expected that this rating will allow to qualitatively and objectively reflect the situation on the conduct of private business in each region, to stimulate healthy competition of local authorities to improve the business environment and attracting investment to the regions, to lay the long-term and systematic basis for evaluating the dynamics of private sector development in the country.
      As you know, work on the formation of a unified export strategy / program of Kazakhstan started today. The Institute has formed a project group with the participation of invited experts and proceeded to the fundamental study of this issue. As a result, the Institute is planning to provide analysis and practical recommendations for MNE of Kazakhstan for the successful implementation of this direction.

      "We are very interested in establishing a dialogue with the expert community, so the work will use all possible tools and platforms to provide quality and professional dialogue with the best experts in the industry," he said.
      In general, the Institute's work is based on close contact not only with the best think tanks and consultants of the world, but also with the local experts.
      "We are absolutely sure that a stable pool of professionals is formed in Kazakhstan at this stage, the potential of which should be used to the full. They deeply understand our specificity, are well versed in international practice and take an active civic stance on economic development. This is - the new trend and we actively participate in it," S.Madiyev said.
      It remains urgent the issue of improving regional policy. Basic approaches of realization of regional policy will be focused on solving a set of measures to expand and strengthen economic independence and responsibility of regions to achieve equivalent living and working conditions.
      World experience shows that the economic development of the country depends on the competitiveness of its constituent regions. In this regard, the Institute will work out measures to improve the competitive advantages of macro-regions and metropolitan areas globally. The logical conclusion of the implementation of regional policy is to identify the strategic growth drivers to enable macro-economy and urban agglomerations in the global markets. This will develop a scenario of spatial development of the country until 2025.
      The main objective, voiced in the Address of the Head of State, is the development of the Strategic Plan of the country till 2025. As noted above, global challenges require a revision of the country's development priorities for the medium term. Currently, the Institute carried out the preparatory work for the development of this document, together with the Ministry of National Economy.
      "All of these initiatives will form the basis of this complex document, which will be the next stage of realization of the strategic goal of joining the 30-ku most developed countries of the world," the head of the Institute said.
      Thus, the Institute is to provide an effective platform for the collection of the best competencies and alternative opinions, constantly adapting and applying new approaches to research, widely introduces field visits of experts to the field, educates and invests in the development of its employees in their daily work uses data best primary sources (Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters Eikon, OECD data), is actively discussing the results of the analysis with the expert community. All this should be the basis for the development of high-quality solutions and instruments developed to implement the President's Address.

      Kazakhstan plans to introduce tax incentives for subsoil users in the economic crisis, said Minister of National Economy Kuandyk Bishimbayev at conference "Actual problems of taxation."

      "Today, the economy in the oil industry has changed, and we understand that the current tax regime for subsoil users is hard in the changed circumstances.

      To date, one of the main priorities of our country's foreign trade policy is to work closely with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). A long-term strategic goal of our country, which is based on best practices and OECD standards, is to enter30 developed countries of the world.

      In 2015, our country has become one of the three countries with which the OECD has developed the first country program. Choosing Kazakhstan as a partner to implement the country program indicates a high level of confidence in our country on the part of OECD member countries.
      The result of this collaboration will be the submission of national legislation into conformity with the principles of the organization, which in turn will improve the quality of governance, improve the business environment, increase business and the country's credit rating, as well as ensure the growth of foreign investment.
      In general, the reviews and the legal instruments of the Country Programme of the OECD recommendations are already reflected in such development programs as strategic plan of Kazakhstan's development for 2025, the Concept of Family and Gender Policy 2030, the Program of the agro-industrial complex development project for 2017-2021 and sectoral laws in the field of competition, investment policy and public administration.
      "At the end of 2016, I would like to celebrate Kazakhstan’s achievements in the framework of cooperation with the OECD on two main areas - competition and investment. This year, Kazakhstan has raised the status to a participant in the Committee of the Competition, as well as the OECD, it was decided to invite Kazakhstan as a participant in the Investment Committee. Kazakhstan is the first country in Central Asia, which has become a participant in these committees," Deputy General Director of the Center for Trade Policy under the Ministry of National Economy of Kazakhstan Nurlan Kulbatyrov said.
      Last year is a turning point in the development of competition policy: reforms aimed at the liberalization of legislation, including simplification of anti-monopoly regulation were adopted in this period. The basis of the new antitrust policy concept is not to fine a businessman, but to inform and warn of the serious consequences of violations of competition law.
      In the framework of the OECD Review of Kazakhstan's antimonopoly practice, the experts noted that Kazakhstan is a country where competition law is progressesing.
      The competitive practice of the principles introduced «Yellow Pages Rule», the essence of which is that in order to maintain a healthy competitive environment it is necessary to limit the establishment of subsidiaries of state-owned companies and to avoid government intervention in the areas of economy, which represents the business. Furthermore, work to enhance the transparency and openness of the tariff process for consumers is conducted.
      Extensive work in the field of entrepreneurship and the private sector has started.
      As of today, Kazakhstan set a target to reduce the proportion of state involvement in the economy to the average level of OECD countries - 15%. A large-scale privatization program is implemented in full swing; it is planned to transfer more than 700 state-owned facilities into the private sector.

In addition, 17 billion tenge is the remainder of the Government’s reserve for emergency and unforeseen expenses, and 300 million tenge is savings. The non-spending of 1.5 billion tenge was due to changes in the terms of supply contracts and the backlog of work. For local budgets, execution amounted to 99.7%.
      Smailov stressed that the share of social expenditures in the republican budget amounted to 44.4% against 34% in 2017.

The Government is faced with the task of increasing expenditures on education and health from all sources to 10% of GDP, today it is 7.4% of GDP, that is, we must bring the share of expenditures on education and health care up to 7.7%.

      Dec. 27 at a briefing in the press center of the Government, Chairman of the State Revenue Committee of the Ministry of Finance Marat Sultangaziyev spoke about the readiness to conduct a tax amnesty.

      In the Address to the People of Kazakhstan “Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Income and Quality of Life,” the Head of State instructed to hold a tax amnesty for small and medium-sized businesses from Jan. 1, 2019, by cancelling the accrued fees and fines, subject to the taxpayer paying the principal amount.
      Sultangaziyev said that the Ministry of Finance had developed relevant amendments to the legislation for tax amnesty, which are currently under consideration by the Senate of Parliament.
      “The draft amendment provides for the cancellation by Dec. 31, 2019, of fines and penalties to small and medium businesses, subject to repayment of the principal debt which was available Oct. 1, 2018. In this case, the fines will be cancelled as of Oct. 1, 2018, and the penalty — accrued before the date of payment of the principal debt,” explained Sultangaziyev.
      According to the chairman, the cancellation of penalties and fines will also apply to taxpayers who, in accordance with the Tax Code or the legislation on rehabilitation and bankruptcy, are deferred to pay taxes or are in a rehabilitation procedure.
      It should be noted that the following are not subject to amnesty: large taxpayers subject to monitoring; subsoil users, with the exception of subsoil users, being such solely because of the possession of the right to extract groundwater, therapeutic mud; producers of excisable goods; individuals who are not engaged in entrepreneurial activities or private practice.
      According to preliminary calculations carried out by the Ministry of Finance, 90,077 subjects of medium and small business fall under the amnesty, and as of Oct. 1, 2018, they have tax debts of 340.6 billion tenge. At the same time, the total amount of penalties to be written off is 122.9 billion tenge, fines — 7.3 billion tenge, which will be cancelled provided that the principal debt is paid for 210.4 billion tenge.
      The committee chairman informed that all the taxpayers who had previously been included in the lists of taxpayers subject to tax amnesty for today have been sent brief information to their Taxpayer’s Offices. To those who do not have a taxpayer’s office, from Jan. 1, 2019, a mailing list will be organized to the residential addresses.
      “We believe that holding a tax amnesty will be an effective mechanism for supporting entrepreneurs and will be an incentive for the payment of the principal debt and complete relief from the tax burden. In general, this action will allow entrepreneurs to reboot their production, save and expand jobs, increase production, and thus contribute to improving the welfare of Kazakhstan, their incomes and quality of life," said Sultangaziyev.
      Recall that in the history of independent Kazakhstan, tax amnesties for writing off penalties and fines to improve the financial and economic activities of enterprises were conducted three times (in 1997–1999, in 2011 and 2015), each time providing an opportunity for businesses to get rid of accumulated debts and continue their legitimate commercial activities .
      According to the Ministry of Finance, within the framework of the two last shares (2011 and 2015), the debts were written off on penalties and fines totaling 143.7 billion tenge, including in 2011 — for 23.1 billion tenge, in 2015 — 120.6 billion tenge.
      Sultangaziyev noted that these shares had a positive effect: 67% of the participants in the latest tax amnesty of 2015 do not have tax debts. These are more than 680 thousand taxpayers, of which over 17 thousand are legal entities, 105 thousand are individual entrepreneurs, 557 thousand are individuals.

      Deputy Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Imangali Tasmagambetov held a meeting on the priority directions of development of science for 2017-2020.

      In today's world, all countries pay special attention to science as a strategically important area of human activity, the fundamental resource of the country, which largely provides its economic growth and competitiveness.
      Increasing the country's scientific potential depends on many factors, including the commercialization of scientific and technological activities. One of the main document that regulates this process in Kazakhstan is the Law of Kazakhstan "On the commercialization of scientific and (or) scientific and technical activities". A number of promising and commercially viable projects have been already implemented.
      "We must clearly understand how many projects that we fund, how much time it will take and, most importantly, what will be future impact," I. Tasmagambetov said during the meeting.
      There is connection between funding, the effectiveness of research and the introduction of clear communication. But it is in direct proportion to the financing and control mechanisms. In addition, the scientist can not successfully deal with the same science, and the promotion of its results into production. To this end, relevant agencies and experts should be involved. It is also necessary to take into account the creation of experimental-industrial base, which would have carried out testing and subsequent implementation development.
      "More than 370 million by private investors was invested over the last 20 years to commercialize our technologies around the world. To date, more than 3.5 billion dollars is allocated for the construction of plants for Kazakhstan technologies on almost every continent; pure metals worth about 4 billion dollars are produced each year, about a third is in Kazakhstan, the rest is abroad," said General Director of RSE «National center on complex processing of mineral raw materials of Kazakhstan» Abdurasul Zharmenov.
      It should be noted that academic institutions and research personnel in Kazakhstan have great potential and could become the basis for a knowledge-based industry. This requires a close connection between science and industry; and the real economy should be researchers’ task.

      During the teleconference on the Industrialization Day, President Nursultan Nazarbayev launched 28 new projects throughout the country. The Head of State summarized the implementation results of the Industrialization Map, identifying new tasks and future prospects. Well-known experts spoke to PrimeMinister.kz about the importance of the industrial and innovative development of Kazakhstan and the upcoming challenges in the future of the country’s economy.

      Getting acquainted with the projects, the Head of State noted that today the country has the tasks to the diversify, improve infrastructure and increase productivity further.
      “During the years of industrialization, we launched 1,250 new enterprises, of which this year 100 were launched. More than 300 thousand jobs were created. Today, 110 countries in the world consume our products. In recent years, we have begun to produce more than 500 types of products not previously manufactured in Kazakhstan, and to export about 50 new types of goods,” said the Head of State.
      The President of Kazakhstan drew attention to the fact that one fourth of all foreign investment falls on the manufacturing sector. In all areas of the manufacturing industry, a shift will be made from industry priorities in favor of supporting efficient producers. The Head of State stressed the importance of carefully exploring the strategy of the third industrialization program with an emphasis on concrete results.
      According to the Ministry for Investments and Development, large-scale work is currently underway to improve business conditions and the investment climate. The industrial policy allows the state together with the business to develop the right investment decisions and to ensure the interconnection of the implementation of private sector projects with the development of infrastructure and the country's resource potential. Its priorities are the diversification of the economy, the creation of high-tech industries, export orientation, productivity, the provision of the domestic market, increasing the share of local content, which will have a positive effect on the economy of Kazakhstan.
      An expert of the Institute of World Economy and Politics under the Foundation of the First President of Kazakhstan Sergey Domnin, in support of the speech of the Head of State noted that the holding of the Industrialization Day is an important reference date for the whole of Kazakhstan. Industrialization is not just the creation of production sites, it is the creation of a new manufacturing industry, the production of high value-added products — this is the main tool for solving the task of diversifying the economy.
      “President Nazarbayev has set this task in all strategic documents since the early 1990s. In this sense, it is symbolic that the Industrialization Day and the Day of the First President (Dec. 1) are chronologically close to each other. During two incomplete five-year periods of the State Program for Industrial-Innovative Development (SPIID: 2010–2014 and 2015–2019), the Government reported on the creation of more than 1,000 projects in non-primary sectors of the economy and over 100,000 new jobs,” Domnin said.
      As the expert noted, the value of the SPIID is not so much the fact that these projects were launched (they could have been introduced without this program, after all, both investor companies and state support mechanisms existed until 2010) but rather that the country finally had unified intelligible industrial policy. The goals were subordinated to the plans and actions of not only the sectoral minister, but also regional akims, and heads of state-owned companies, and private business, who in Kazakhstan always listened keenly to the wishes of the authorities.
      "The outpacing growth of foreign investment in the manufacturing sector (an average of 26% per year with 18% per year in the mining sector and 2% in the economy) is in the list of achievements of Kazakhstan's industrialization," said Domnin.
      Moreover, according to the specialist, the third five-year industrialization (2020–2024), the concept of which is currently being worked out, aims to continue the development of the manufacturing industry. But this time, the focus has been shifted to export-oriented manufacturing enterprises, the support of which will be given attention: for example, the group of “successful exporters” (definition from the concept of the Third SPIID), the Government plans to issue grants for technical re-equipment, subsidize the rate and help promote the production in foreign markets.
      “Industrialization continues, and now it can already be called one of the longest programs in the system of Kazakh state planning. If we take its history from the strategy of industrial-innovative development, launched in 2003, — the outgoing year will be the 15th in the history of Kazakhstan's industrialization. Nine years have passed since the start of the five-year industrialization period. Next year is decisive in this sense: before the start of the new stage, it’s time to take stock of the previous ones,” concluded the expert.

      First Vice Minister of Industry and Infrastructure Development Roman Sklyar said this at a press conference in the Government’s press center.

       
      “The growth from $29.6 thousand to $31.4 thousand was reached in the course of industrialization years (an increase of 3.6%). Definitely, many factors affect labor productivity, but the state provides support, and this has its effect. Any modernization, introduction of digital technologies entails an increase in labor productivity, which is a key factor in the competitiveness of products. We are constantly working on this,” said Sklyar.
      At the same time, the first vice minister noted that one of the key constraints to productivity growth is the technological level of development of the manufacturing industries.
      “In order to support our enterprises, the state uses various incentive tools. Thus, the program ‘Productivity – 2020’ provides a number of mechanisms that we use. About 500 million tenge was paid in 2018 to enterprises for applying new technologies, subsidies were given for research and development work, and leasing loans  through the Development Bank of Kazakhstan, which allows companies to technologically re-equip and be competitive. In addition, special export support programs also stimulate enterprises when entering foreign markets, which naturally entails an increase in labor productivity,” said Sklyar, stressing that the ministry’s task is to provide enterprises with all the mechanisms of state support.

      During his working trip to the Karaganda region, the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan evaluated the development potential of the metallurgical complex in the region.

      At the copper electrolysis plant site, the Chairman of the Board of LLP "Kazakhmys Corporation", B. Krykpyshev, told the Prime Minister about the work of the structural divisions of the company, and the prospects of non-ferrous metals in the world and domestic market.
      Last year, the corporation division, including the Zhezkazgan copper-smelting plant, produced about 223 thousand tons of cathode copper, which exceeded the planned target by 3%. Despite the difficulties in the global economy, reducing demand and copper prices, the company group intends to keep copper production at the same level as in the 2014-2015 period. 
      During the first half of 2016, the corporation divisions produced 111 thousand tons of cathode copper, which is 8% more than what was produced in the same period last year.
      In 2014, the plant went through a major reconstruction. To continue the modernization of the plant, a project for the transition to innovative production technology, to extract copper from low-grade ores (raw materials with low metal content) is being implemented. The capacity to process ore with low metal content is a very important direction for Kazakhstan, as new technologies allow the utilization of off-balance ore, accumulated in the mines .
      Currently, the company produces copper using old technology - pyro (electrofusion). In tge meantime, tests are being conducted to obtain copper cathodes by hydrometallurgical processing of low-grade raw materials.
      As noted by B. Krykpyshev, the investment project will allow metallurgical companies to compensate for the raw material base, and extend the duration of profitable operations of existing production for more than 40 years. And most importantly - it will provide employment.
      In the future, the company plans to build two hydrometallurgical plants, in Kazakhstan, to produce copper concentrate.
      In turn, the Akim of the Karaganda region, N.Abdibekov, reported to the Prime Minister on the implementation of a comprehensive plan for socio-economic development of the Zhezkazgan region. According to him, by 2020, 88 events on the modernization of industrial enterprises, infrastructure construction , and geological exploration are planned to be implemented. 28 events have already been completed, and another seven projects will be implemented this year.
      The state program of Industrial-Innovative Development of Kazakhstan from 2015-2019 , aims to accelerate the diversification of the economy.
      The second five-year plan of the state program of Industrial-Innovative Development identifies six priority sectors of the manufacturing industry, in which the steel industry is in the first place. Other priority sectors include: chemical, petrochemical, machinery, building materials, and the food industry.
      In Kazakhstan, LLP "Corporation" Kazakhmys" accounts for a share of about 85% of copper concentrate produced in the country, and 90% of refined copper. Kazakh copper is mostly exported to China, Russia and Uzbekistan. The company is working on expanding the raw material base in Kazakhstan through the development of the new Boschekul (Pavlodar region) and Aktogay (East Kazakhstan region) deposits. 
      The extraction of copper ore in the country is also conducted by JSC "Kazzinc", LLP "Aktobe Copper Company, and JSC" Maikainzoloto".

      From the first days of independence, Kazakhstan has taken the course of accelerated industrialization. Since that time, over one thousand new high-tech industries have been created, which have given the country hundreds of types of new productions and thousands of jobs.

      In continuation of the national teleconference dedicated to the Industrialization Day, based on the data from the Ministry for Investments and Development, a review on the implementation of the industrial policy of Kazakhstan was prepared.
       
      During the years of independence, several stages of economic modernization have been carried out in Kazakhstan. The first stage of modernization of Kazakhstan was the creation of a new state, when the transition from a planned to a market economy took place. Changes that took place in Kazakhstan from 1991 to 1997 became the first upgrade. In a short period, Kazakhstan managed to strengthen and develop the political, economic systems, statehood of the republic, to achieve recognition in the international arena.
      1996–2012 called the period of the Second forced modernization. The second modernization began with the adoption of the Kazakhstan-2030 Strategy and the creation of a new capital of Astana. The strategy was promulgated in 1997. This document of great historical and political significance for the first time proclaimed the need to develop an industrial strategy for Kazakhstan: sustainable economic growth through diversification of production and attracting significant foreign investment. The country broke out of the economic lag zone and was among the 50 competitive economies in the world.
      In 2003, the Strategy for Industrial-Innovative Development of Kazakhstan was adopted. A number of specialized institutes of industrial-innovative infrastructure were created in the country – National Fund, Development Bank of Kazakhstan, Investment Fund of Kazakhstan, National Innovation Fund.
      The main focus was on stimulating entrepreneurship and the creation of new industries.
      In May 2009, President Nazarbayev announced the start of a five-year period of forced industrial-innovative development. Instead of raw material development, Kazakhstan chose the path of active solutions. The manufacturing industry has become more attractive for investment. Since 2010, more than $26 billion has been invested in the manufacturing sector. Almost every fifth dollar of foreign direct investment is accounted for processing.
      Today, Kazakhstan products are exported to 112 countries. 1080 projects worth 5.5 trillion tenge were introduced, 101 thousand permanent jobs were created. The efficiency of use of fuel and energy resources has increased. During the years of industrialization, the energy intensity of the economy of Kazakhstan has decreased by more than 15%.
      The reliance on the industrial model allowed Kazakhstan to pass the test of a new wave of global recession. Thanks to this, Kazakhstan almost tripled its GDP (compared to 2009 – from 17 to 46.9 trillion tenge), the industry grew by more than 2 times (from 9.1 to 19 trillion tenge), the manufacturing industry grew by 2.7 times (from 2.9 to 8 trillion tenge), the number of operating enterprises increased from 188.8 to 236.1 thousand, the production of innovative products increased fivefold (from 82.6 to 445.8 billion tenge).
      The third modernization started in 2015. It was then that Nazarbayev proposed the Five Institutional Reforms. In the Address to the People of Kazakhstan “Third Modernization of Kazakhstan: Global Competitiveness,” the Head of State stressed that this modernization is not a plan to deal with current global challenges, but a reliable bridge to the future, towards the goals of the Strategy 2050. It will be carried out on the basis of the Nationwide 100 Concrete Steps Plan and is designed to ensure the growth rate of the economy is higher than the world average and steady progress into the list of 30 advanced countries.
       
      In 2015, the implementation of the SPIID until 2019 began. The program is a logical continuation of the first five years of industrialization and part of the country's economic policy. The main goal of the program is to stimulate the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry, increase labor productivity and the volume of exports of processed goods.
      The SPIID provides four target indicators in the manufacturing industry until 2019: an increase in the value of exports of manufacturing products, a real growth in labor productivity, the higher volume of investment in fixed capital and a decrease in its energy intensity.
      2017 was a year of great institutional breakthrough. New state programs, support measures, a point investment policy and technological re-equipment of the industry have emerged, which are designed to help the country effectively go the way of the third modernization. The focus is on the human resource: mass entrepreneurship and effective employment are hundreds of thousands of new jobs and a competitive nation.
      The second five-year period of industrialization is nearing its completion, but already today the Ministry of Investment and Development claims that the Program being implemented is fully in line with the goals set, having a positive effect on the sustainability and positive growth dynamics of the manufacturing sector.
      Summing up the implementation of the SPIID for 11 months of 2018, it is necessary to identify the main directions of its implementation:
      ● attraction of investments;
      ● export promotion;
      ● stimulation of labor productivity.
       
      According to the Ministry for Investments and Development, in order to attract foreign direct investment in the economy, various events are held: business forums, investment conferences, meetings with the business community.
      As part of the official visits of the Head of State to foreign countries, business meetings with business circles of foreign parties were organized and held. The visits helped to sign 114 bilateral commercial documents totaling about $22 billion.
      Following the results of 11 months of 2018, the Ministry for Investments and Development held 11 business forums in the country and two business forums abroad with the participation of representatives of the Government, business circles, national and transnational companies.
      In order to present investment opportunities, develop measures to improve the investment climate and increase the competitiveness of the national economy, July 3, 2018, an international investment forum was held in Astana with the participation of more than 600 heads of major world companies. A significant part of the participants was represented by companies from priority countries for Kazakhstan: from the US – 43 companies, Great Britain – 60, Germany – 37, France – 28, Turkey – 60, United Arab Emirates – 74, China – 49, Russia – 30. On the margins of the forum bilateral meetings with foreign investors were held, 32 agreements totaling $4.8 billion were signed.
       
      The promotion of exports is also one of the key areas. Specially established export company KazakhExport JSC provides government support measures (insurance and reinsurance of risks) exclusively to manufacturers and exporters of the manufacturing sector.
      For 10 months of 2018, KazakhExport provided support to 40 domestic exporters, supported 237 export contracts, export trade financing for 6.97 billion tenge, pre-export financing for 4.6 billion tenge, the total amount of liabilities amounted to 44.6 billion tenge.
      This year, within the framework of service (non-financial) support of exporters, the Foreign Trade Chamber of Kazakhstan as of Dec. 4, 2018 conducted and organized 15 trade missions in 11 countries, 4 national stands in 4 countries, 7 promotional and presentation events in 4 countries, participated in 27 specialized exhibitions in 12 countries. As a result, 68 contracts were concluded for a total amount of $457 million.
       
      At the same time, it turns out that the state support is aimed at increasing the labor productivity of the subjects of industrial innovation activity. So, to date, the costs of 42 enterprises have been reimbursed for 482.1 million tenge, including:
      As part of the implementation of the SPIID, systemic measures are being taken to support enterprises, new productions are being launched, and existing enterprises are being modernized and expanded.
      To date, eight projects carried out modernization and expansion of existing industries. It is also worth noting that in the framework of the Industrialization Map of the introduced projects (100 projects), in 2018 more than 300 thousand permanent jobs were created.
       
      During the years of industrialization, the share of the manufacturing industry in the GDP structure increased by 0.8 pp (from 10.9% in 2009 to 11.7% in January-September 2018); in industry – by 2.1 pp (from 35.6% in 2009 to 37.7% in January-October 2018); in investments in fixed assets – by 11.1 pp (from 8.2% to 19.3%, respectively); in the total export volume, a decline – by 1.7 pp (from 27.8% in 2009 to 26.1% in January-August 2018).
      In January-October 2018, the following industries accounted for the largest share in the structure of the manufacturing industry: metallurgy (45.3%), mechanical engineering (9.9%), food (14.9%), oil refining (8.3%).
      During this period, the largest share of investments in fixed capital in the manufacturing industries is occupied by the production of coke and refined products (49%), metallurgy (19.4%), food (8.8%), construction materials (7.7%).
      In January-August 2018, metallurgy (57.6%), oil refining (14.8%), food (6.9%), construction materials (1.3%) occupied more than half of the share in the export-processing industry.
      In January-October 2018, the manufacturing sector produced worth 8.5 trillion tenge. The increase was compared with the same period in 2017 by 5.4%. In a number of sectors of the manufacturing industry, there is an increase: metallurgy – by 4.6%, engineering – by 14.2%, chemistry – by 8.5%, oil refining – by 9.2%, food production – by 2.8%.
      Exports of manufacturing products for the first 9 months of 2018 amounted to $11,476. 9 thousand, which is 3.4% more than the same period of the previous 2017, which amounted to $11,096 thousand. In particular, exports of metals (copper, aluminum, metal, semi-finished products) and petroleum products (petroleum gases, petroleum coke, etc.). Exports of sunflower oil, soft drinks, fish products, pasta, etc. increased from food products.
      Exports of fertilizers, polypropylene increased from the chemical industry, exports of pesticides and phosphinates increased twice. Exports from the engineering industry increased: bearings, batteries, transformers, cable products, consoles, panels, consoles, etc.
      Labor productivity in the manufacturing industry for the first half of 2018 was $15.5 thousand / person.
      The volume of investments in fixed assets of the manufacturing industry in January-October 2018 amounted to 1,005 billion tenge, an increase of 32.2% over the same period 2017. The growth was due to the production of coke and refined products – by 1.5 times, the metallurgical industry – by 1.5 times, and food products – by 33.7%.
       
      Industrial policy, as the core of the general economic policy of the state, should be associated primarily with the innovative restructuring of production.
      In 2017, work was carried out to develop measures for the technological re-equipment of industry, including elements of the fourth industry revolution.
      We have developed measures that are aimed at creating the necessary ecosystem to support our enterprises that are planning to digitize and stimulate more active introduction of digital technologies. These measures are included in the Digital Kazakhstan state program.
      One of the main projects is the creation of model digital factories based on existing enterprises. In this connection, seven enterprises were selected and work continued with the Fraunhofer Institute for technological diagnostics and the development of digitalization plans.
      1. Kentau Transformer Plant JSC (mechanical engineering)
      2. Eurasian Foods JSC (food industry)
      3. Chimpharm JSC (pharmaceutical industry)
      4. JSC AK Altynalmas (metallurgy)
      5. Karlskrona LLP (mechanical engineering)
      6. Almaty Fan Plant LLP (mechanical engineering)
      7. Bal Textile LLP (light industry)
      Currently, work has been completed on technological diagnostics, selected enterprises and the development of road maps for the introduction of digital technologies on them.
      In total, experts recommended more than 200 measures (projects), from 20 to 38 measures for each enterprise, held meetings with companies to discuss the proposed measures.
      An important effect of the digital technology is to increase safety, especially in hazardous industries. In this regard, a draft Regulation on ensuring industrial safety for hazardous production facilities conducting mining and geological exploration, taking into account the application of digital technologies to improve industrial safety, has been developed. In December 2018, these Rules will be approved by the Ministry for Investments and Development.
      For the innovative interaction in the extractive sector, the project Extraction 4.0 is being implemented (testing and transfer of domestic solutions at the production facility).
      To date, in order to stimulate business to introduce advanced digital technologies in the framework of the Productivity 2020 program, appropriate changes have been made to the Rules for granting state support to industrial and innovation entities aimed at increasing labor productivity. The main innovation is the focus on reimbursement for the introduction of technologies in Industry 4.0.
      In parallel, work is underway to implement projects for the digitization of backbone enterprises. In total, up to 2025, 14 projects worth 140.2 billion tenge are planned for implementation. The economic effect of their implementation is expected to reach 239.8 billion tenge until 2025. Of these, 3 projects were implemented in 2017 (2 ERG projects, 1 KazZinc project).
      Plans are being developed to digitize regions with different deadlines for the period up to 2025. From the information provided, 143 digitalization projects are expected to be implemented (86 enterprises), of which 72 projects (49 enterprises) should be implemented in 2018.
      In order to increase competitiveness, large, export-oriented domestic enterprises have begun to introduce technologies of the fourth industrial revolution in their industries. For example:
      In general, it should be noted that the measures taken to stimulate the transition to Industry 4.0 will contribute to increasing the share of large and medium-sized enterprises that have introduced digital technologies to 11% in 2022. By increasing productivity, including through digital technologies by 39.8% (by 2016) and will be about 30 million tenge in the mining sector and by 48.9% (13.9 million tenge) in the manufacturing industry.
       
      Dec. 4, 2018, at a regular meeting of the Government chaired by the Prime Minister, the draft Concept of the State Program for Industrial and Innovative Development for 2020–2025 was approved in accordance with the instructions of the Head of State, given in the Address “Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Income and Quality of Life."
      The concept envisages such areas as the development of the “economy of simple things,” the saturation of the market with domestic goods, support for exporters in the manufacturing industry and the implementation of large, breakthrough projects through the attraction of private investments, including foreign ones. At the same time, continuity with the Strategic Development Plan-2025 was ensured, and key initiatives and principles were taken into account.
      According to the Ministry of Investment and Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the main provisions and approaches to the Concept were developed in close cooperation with NPP Atameken and industry associations. So, in October 2018, the draft Concept was reviewed and generally approved at a meeting of the Expert Council on Economics. The main approaches to the Concept were also presented to the deputies of the Mazhilis of the Parliament of Kazakhstan.
      The Ministry for Investments and Development assured that, in general, industrial policy will maintain continuity and will be focused on the development of the manufacturing industry. The existing infrastructure and institutional framework will be used fully.
      The approaches to the Concept of the Third Industrialization Program are based on key challenges for further qualitative growth and sustainable competitiveness of the manufacturing industry: insufficient investment in fixed capital, an unformed critical mass of enterprises, low “complexity” of products.
      The goal of industrial innovation policy is to stimulate the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry in the domestic and foreign markets. This goal will be achieved by solving three problems:
      For the successful achievement of the goals and objectives, the ministry offers 5 areas of industrial and innovative development.
      1. Conducting a proactive trade policy aimed at removing barriers to foreign trade within the framework of the EAEU, access to the markets of China, Central and South Asia, as well as rational protection of the domestic market.
      2. Advance creation of specialized factors of production at growth points. Efforts will be directed to the development of high-quality industrial, digital and certification infrastructure, human capital, centers of competence.
      3. Creation of new capital-intensive and knowledge-intensive industries, using the state's capabilities in the distribution of raw materials and the provision of attractive conditions for investors.
      4. Direct support for efficient enterprises in the domestic and foreign markets. Efficiency will be measured by the capacity for sustainable competition in the domestic and foreign markets.
      5. Improving the efficiency of the support system for industrial innovation through more precise adjustment of the processes of coordination, financing and monitoring of industrialization policies.
      The third industrialization program will differ from the two previous five-year plans. First, a transition will be made from industry priorities in favor of supporting efficient producers in all sectors of the manufacturing industry. Second, efforts will be focused on the development of new, expansion and "complication" of the existing range of products, including consumer goods. Third, direct support will be provided in exchange for the counter obligations of the business to achieve specific indicators (modernization, export growth, etc.). Fourth, as part of preparing the industry for the digital age, the necessary infrastructure and standards will be created.
      Enterprise support based on a balanced development model will also be continued. Enterprises will receive comprehensive support at all stages of their development - from beginner to successful. In the future, attention will be paid to three groups of enterprises.
      The first group “Strong rear” is manufacturing enterprises, due to which the volumes and assortment of domestic products, including consumer goods, will be increased, and a pool of future exporters will be created.
      The second group is "Competitive Manufacturers." These are the existing exporters, their tasks: expanding the number of products and increasing the complexity of the export basket.
      The third group, “Gravity Centers,” consists large, capital-intensive projects, including in the basic industries, as well as with the participation of TNCs and foreign investors. At the expense of them, the production of new types of industrial semi-finished products will be assured and the necessary raw materials will be provided.
      According to the results of the Third Industrialization Program, it is planned to achieve the main indicators in the manufacturing industry. Among them, real growth in investment in fixed assets is 2 times, real growth in labor productivity by 1.7 times, growth in exports of processed goods by 2.3 times, an increase in the Index of Economic Complexity to 55, an increase in the number of active enterprises per 1000 people, economically active — 2.3 times.
      The Ministry for Investments and Development believes that the voiced approaches to the Concept of the Third Industrialization Program will strengthen the work on further increasing the value added in the economy, “complicating” the produced basket of goods and expanding its presence in foreign markets.

      It is planned to launch first junk car recycling plant with the capacity from 10 to 15 cars per year in six months that will allow Kazakhstanis to recycle their scrap cars, said First Deputy Minister for Investment and Development Albert Rau, during the press conference at CCS.

      Earlier, it was reported that Kazakhstan delays the construction of the first junk car recycling plant. However, official information about the delay was not received. In this regard, A. Rau said that the plants will be launched in the near future.
      "Everything is established. Currently, tendering procedures are held. According to the latest data, the first plant will be launched in six months," said A. Rau.
      According to him, Kazakhstan plans to launch at least three junk car recycling plants with capacity of about 10 to 15 cars per year. The plants will be located in close proximity to large cities of Kazakhstan, such as Astana, Karaganda, Almaty and Shymkent. In the future, if the business will be profitable, they plan to increase it.
      "The receiving points will be located in each region, and then after the press they will be packed for transportation and sent to the factory for further disassembly. Our task is to get rid of recycled spare car parts and prevent secondary use. We are talking about road safety, if recycled spare car parts get on the secondary market," A. Rau said.
      According to A. Rau, Russia created barriers first when was defending itself from reducing customs duties at the entry into WTO. Kazakhstan introduced the same thing, only in accordance with the Environmental Code.
      "The barriers are mutual. Russians compensate scrap, assemblage for their producers, when the realization comes to the domestic market. When the realization comes to the foreign market, they avoid payment. We will have about a similar scheme. We must also consider the issues of compensation to the external market. Everything is fine in domestic market. Domestic enterprises receive not compensation, but state support for the production of environmentally friendly cars. Therefore, we have synchronized actions," A. Rau said.

      Chairman of the Committee for Sports and Physical Culture of the Ministry of Culture Sports Serik Zharasbayev told about this and other measures taken to develop mass sports and physical culture in general as part of the implementation of the President’s Address “Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Income and Quality of Life,” in an exclusive interview with PrimeMinister.kz.

      In the Address, the Head of State focused on the development of mass sports and improving the health of the population. Zharasbayev emphasizes that the Ministry of Culture and Sports in its policy puts these issues fundamental. According to the Agency of Statistics, the 2018 results indicate that about 29.8% of the population is regularly engaged in sports. This is just over 5 million people, including all age categories.
      “In order to meet the demand of this population in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and sports, naturally, sports facilities are needed. Today, according to the Statistics Agency, there are more than 9 thousand sports facilities in both rural and urban areas in the country. These are basic facilities. Their availability and quality are also noted in the Address of the Head of State. An instruction was given to increase the construction of sports facilities. Today, together with local and other state bodies, we are carrying out this work,” said Committee Chairman Zharasbayev.
      As part of the fulfillment of the Head of State’s instructions to increase the coverage of the country's population in physical education and sports, special attention is paid to the development of mass sports among children and young people.
      According to the Ministry of Education and Science, a little more than 80% of schools are provided with sports halls and sports facilities.
      “There is still room for improvement, there is room for growth, especially since sport starts at school. School sport is the key link to rely on. If we imagine a certain pyramid in the sport, where the Olympic Games are at the top, then the whole basis is made up of junior and school sports, which is well represented in the country today,” said Zharasbayev.
      According to the committee chairman, today more than 400 children’s youth sports schools work all over the country, where more than 400 thousand people are engaged. Zharasbayev stressed that these organizations are open to athletes who are striving for great results. There is a clear selection system in the schools. There are certain periods: groups of initial training, training, sports skills, higher skills, etc. Coaches and school management understand the potential of everyone already at the initial stage, and recommend their pupils to higher organizations.
      “I would like to emphasize in these schools are free of charge in Kazakhstan. All state sports schools are maintained at the expense of local or regional budgets and are funded by the state. Getting into a youth school is quite simple. The main thing is the absence of contraindications from the doctor,” Zharasbayev informed.
      At the same time, in all regional centers there are specialized boarding schools for children gifted in sports. These are more specialized organizations which select the best participants who meet the following criteria — sports titles, the presence of ranks, the availability of prizes at republican international competitions, participation in various republican tournaments — from the above-mentioned schools. Today, there are 12 regional and five republican boarding schools in the country. The total number of students is 8 thousand people.
      The National Plan of the Government was approved in the implementation of the Address “Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Income and Quality of Life,” where three points are marked — 44, 46, 48, which the Ministry of Culture and Sports is directly responsible for implementing. One of these points is the construction of 100 fitness centers.
      As Zharasbayev noted, the Ministry of Culture and Sports, together with interested authorities and local executive bodies, carried out a needs analysis, identified the main criteria where these facilities will be built. These are settlements with a population of at least 3 thousand people. It was taken into account that the growth points in these settlements were fundamental, there was a need for sports and the desire of the population to play sports. As a result, a list of localities was determined, where 100 health and fitness centers will be built within three years.
      At the same time, the Chairman of the Committee noted that new physical culture and recreation centers will be built predominantly in rural areas.
      “After analyzing, we determined exactly rural areas, 90% is rural areas. But there are some cities that have expressed a desire to build the centers. As a rule, all our Olympics participants were from the village and we must create conditions and build the centers in the village, where there is great potential,” Zharasbayev emphasized.
      Public-private partnership also contributes to the construction of sports facilities, attracting private investment in the development of sports and there are some benefits. As noted by Zharasbayev, in 2017-2018 the Street Workout Federation together with the Ministry of Culture and Sports has been actively involved in the construction of open sports grounds. In two years, the organization has managed to build about 70 open sites at its own expense in all regions of the country. Sites operate on a free basis.
      “This is a certain element of PPP. Together with the Federation, we appealed to local executive bodies with a request to provide us with land for the installation of these simulators. Akimat provided a land plot, then the Federation built the object. This work will continue. The National Olympic Committee also joined the work,” explained Zharasbayev.
      In the regions in 2017–2018 about 30 health and fitness complexes were built in the framework of public-private partnership.
      Also Zharasbayev notes the increased interest of entrepreneurs.
      “About 10 years ago, not all businessmen were so eager to go into the construction of sports facilities: forgive it was to build a trading house, rent it out and receive dividends from it. Today, thanks to such a program, businessmen are ready to join the sport and build sports facilities,” said the chairman of the Committee on Sports and Physical Culture.

      During the Kazakhstan Government, Minister of Energy Kanat Bozumbayev meeting spoke about the taken measures to involve local oil service companies in the oil and gas industry's major projects.

      "To address problematic oilfield issues, Kazakhstan established a working group to develop proposals for the inclusion of domestic oilfield service companies in the oil and gas industry's major projects," K. Bozumbayev has said. 
      The Minister noted that the working group had raised and discussed current problems and possible solutions.
      "Thus, it may be noted that Kazakhstan companies do not have experience in complex types of work, which causes concerns to operators about their compliance with the requirements. We solved this problem by creating a consortium between foreign and local companies," K. Bozumbayev said.
      He also said that the companies are faced with the establishment of excessive demands in procurement and complaints about the procurement of oil and gas companies with foreign participation. In this regard, the Ministry carried out the relevant work.
      In addition, according to him, the suppliers complain about prequalification in the procurement procedures of large operators take a long time. In this regard, a unified "Alash" database was created on the initiative of the Ministry, which will eventually replace the database of operators, and at an early stage will allow domestic businesses to register three operators through a "single window" service system.
      "The Ministry continues work on introduction of the practice of" early tender "and trial orders to supply competitive Kazakhstani goods, works and services on major projects. This means that Kazakh Company, which undertakes to set up production of essential products in the country, wins the contract. There will be a guaranteed sale market after the launch of production, " K. Bozumbayev said.

      In 2017, projects of modernization of three oil refineries in Kazakhstan come to the finish line. After that, the volume of processing will increase from 14.5 million to 17, 5 million tons of oil, said Minister of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan at a press conference.

      The Minister noted that modernization of Pavlodar and Atyrau refineries will be completed in the second half of 2017 and the completion of the modernization of Shymkent plant is planned in the first half of 2018.
      "In his address, the Head of State stressed the need to increase the volume of oil refining. Modernization of our refineries will increase the production of light oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, " said the Minister.
      Thus, the Ministry expects the full provision of domestic needs of the country's domestic oil products and excludes import dependence on the number of lubricants in 2019.
      To date, there is a 30% dependency on the domestic market of the Russian Federation. If 70% of the needs met by our three refineries, then 30% of the fuel imported from outside. Ability to import from the outside is only available from the Russian Federation, the Minister said. At the same time, Kazakhstan can not affect the wholesale prices of the Russian Federation. The only way out of this situation is to complete modernization of plants faster.
      "Of course, we can fix the price at the pump again. But where it leads? Russian wholesalers will not be able to bring it here, because they will not carry it without any benefit for themselves. Then begins a 30% deficit in gas stations. We have already passed such a scenario. It is true that price for gasoline is more expensive, but we have it. And it's better than when gasoline is cheaper and we do not have it. If the deficit appears, hence the quality of fuel will be poor, "  said the Minister.
      According to him, depending on the pricing, situation on the Russian market will remain until they are modernized domestic refineries.
      "Last year, I traveled to all three plants, the tasks set for the respective companies, there is moneyance, equipment, the optimistic mood. Since last year, we have accelerated the pace of work in all three areas, " concluded K.Bozumbayev.

      Within the framework of his working visit to South Kazakhstan Region, Karim Massimov, visited LLP "PetroKazakhstan Oil Products».

      The President of PetroKazakhstan Oil Products, T. Shi and the First Vice-President A. Turisbekov, presented a report on the implementation of a large-scale project, which is included in the government's Program of Modernization of Refineries in Kazakhstan, to Prime Minister Karim Massimov. The project, "Modernization and reconstruction of the Shymkent oil refinery," began in 2011, and all works are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2017.
      Between January-May 2016, the volume of industrial production of the Shymkent Oil Refinery, in monetary terms, amounted to more than 22 billion tenge. After modernization, the plant will produce high-octane gasoline that will meet the environmental requirements of class K5 (an analog of Euro-5 in EEU countries). The processing capacity of the plant is expected to grow from 5.2 million to 6 million tons of crude oil, with a depth of refinery of up to 90%.
      Today, three oil refineries operate in Kazakhstan- in the Pavlodar, Atyrau and South Kazakhstan regions. However, they do not meet the demand of the domestic market.
      The Head of State of the Government of Kazakhstan has paid special attention to the issues of development of domestic fuel and energy markets. During Prime Minister Karim Massimov’s working trip to the region, he visited the refineries in Pavlodar and Atyrau, where he also reviewed the progress of modernization and reconstruction, crucial for Kazakhstan’s production levels. In addition, in Atyrau, the Prime Minister held a meeting on issues of the domestic oil service. As a result of the meeting, the Prime Minister instructed the establishment of two working groups, responsible for collecting and summarizing weak spots, and working out concrete proposals to address the challenges within a month. 
      The modernization of all three of Kazakhstan's refineries are expected to provide import substitution in Kazakhstan’s automotive fuel market by 2018.
      According to the Ministry of National Economy of Kazakhstan, from January-June 2016: 1,527 million tons of gasoline (13.6% more than in the same period of 2015); 2,370 million tons of diesel fuel (grew by 10.6%); 1,408 million tons of fuel oil (decreased by 13.5% ) were produced. 
      During the first half of the year, Kazakhstan refineries produced 13.6% more petrol, 10.6% more diesel than in the previous year.
      After decreasing by 29.4% in 2014 and 15.8% in 2015, the positive trend of the first half of this year, a positive trend of optimism has returned to the industry. 
      In terms of growth on a regional level, among the three oil refineries, the Pavlodar region is at a lead - plus 63% year-to-year, up to 35.7 billion tenge. Next - Atyrau (plus 55.5% per year, up to 193.7 billion tenge) and the South Kazakhstan Region (plus 25.3%, up to 32.1 billion tenge).
      In the oil service market of Kazakhstan, there are more than 1,000 companies, with a total of 160 thousand employees. The oil service accounts for 40-50% of the total procurement of license holders. Therefore, the future of Kazakhstan’s local content and employment depends on development of the service business.

      "Alash" portal will help to increase the local content in the oil and gas sector, manager of the projects of the Union of oilfield services companies in Kazakhstan Niyaz Zhumat has said during a press conference.

      «База данных поставщиков «Алаш» создана по инициативе Министерства энергетики РК с прямым участием крупнейших международных нефтегазовых компаний ТШО, КПО, NCOC. Сделано это было в рамках Актауской декларации о совместных действиях от сентября 2012 года», – сказал Н. Жумат.
      По его словам, реализация проекта «Алаш» является точкой, в которой сходятся интересы трех самых главных сторон нефтегазового рынка Казахстана.
      «Это государство, которое на протяжении 20 лет пытается создать условия, приемлемые для нефтегазового рынка, создает требования по местному содержанию. Вторая сторона – операторы, которые тоже заинтересованы в том, чтобы работать с систематизированной системой закупа, чтобы информация была обширной и имела полную базу всех поставщиков, которые имеются на рынке, все предложения были видны. И третья сторона – сами поставщики, которые смогут посредством данной базы, пройдя предквалификацию в ней, участвовать в процедурах закупок сразу трех компаний-недропользователей», – подчеркнул управляющий по проектам.
      Ожидается, что портал «Алаш» упростит процедуру закупок данных недропользователей и придаст открытость закупкам, а также увеличит казсодержание в нефтегазовом секторе.
      «Наше видение – переход операторов ТШО, КПО и NCOC от нынешней закрытой системы к базе данных «Алаш» повысит конкурентоспособность казахстанских компаний в виду того, что операторы, работавшие до этого в своих узких базах, у каждого оператора своя база, они смогут иметь общую базу всех поставщиков и могут узнать о других поставщиках, которые успешно работают по тем же направлениям, в которых они заинтересованы. Помимо практических плюсов, использование системы Алаш приближает компании-заказчиков к реализации целей, обозначенных Правительством РК. То есть цели о создании максимальных условий по развитию казахстанского содержания в нефтегазовом рынке», – отметил он.
      Разработчики также добавили, что база данных «Алаш» имеет 24-часовую круглосуточную техническую поддержку, которая готова оказать консультативную помощь на любом этапе работы с базой.

      «The current G20 Summit is gathering during a very difficult time… The growth rates of global economic growth, trade and capital flows are decreasing. This is reflected today on the welfare of millions of people around the world. The formation of new transcontinental trade and investment associations may lead to a decrease of the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) role and fragmentation of the world economy. These processes may become the beginning of a new stage of war in the international markets. The path of global development largely depends on the coherence of the entire international community,» Nursultan Nazarbayev said to the participants of the G20 Summit. 
      In this regard, the President of Kazakhstan stated that in his view, the leading role in international economy and finance regulation should be played by a single global organization. 
      “Such a structure can be created through the transformation of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) into the Global Development Council, which should serve as a global economic regulator,” he said.
      Following the discussions, the participants of the summit agreed on a new innovative approach for the development of the world economy. The proposal of the President of Kazakhstan, on the establishment of a Global UN Development Council, was reflected in the Hangzhou Consensus.
      The main set of criteria of the «Hangzhou Consensus» include: vision, integration, openness, and inclusiveness. The Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, Karim Massimov, posted this list on his Instagram account. 
      «We are determined to improve global economic and financial governance to enhance the resilience of the world economy. We have agreed to advance the quota and governance reform of international financial institutions», said the Chinese President Xi Jinxing during the closing ceremony of the G20 Summit. 
      According to him, the participants of the G20 summit stressed the importance of the transition from a crisis response mechanism to a long-term governance mechanism. 
      Moreover, an agreement on the modernization of the regulation of international trade and investment has been made.

      June 18 at a briefing in the press center of the Government, Vice Minister of Education and Science Bibigul Assylova told about the ongoing work to improve the living conditions of students in the framework of the implementation of the President’s Five Social Initiatives.

      According to the vice minister, the need for student dormitories today is about 83 thousand places. Together with akimats, work is carried out to allocate land for the construction of the buildings. To date, 134 sites have been allocated on the territory or near education organizations.
      In addition, a mechanism for the construction of hostels has been defined.
      "It is quite simple and understandable. The developer makes a hostel project. Then he signs an agreement to receive government contracts with the Financial Center. Then he gets a loan from the bank. After commissioning the dormitory, he receives compensation payments from the state," Assylova explained.
      To simplify the procedure, the Committee of Construction developed standard projects of dormitories, which had been given to all akimats. In addition, the question of lowering the interest rate on loans in banks by including the construction of hostels in the Business Road Map is being worked out.
      The vice minister noted that the analysis showed the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism for the construction of dormitories and its compliance with the budgetary policy in the country. So, with the target allocation of funds from the republican budget for the construction of hostels, the state would need about 400 billion tenge, while with the proposed mechanism these expenses are reduced to 150 billion tenge.
      Thus, a significant reduction in the burden on the republican budget will be achieved, both in the amount of expenditures and in the time period. The mechanism is approved by the business community and educational organizations.
      An interactive map has been developed and operates taking into account all needs, available and working online on 
      . The map, according to Assylova, provides an opportunity to obtain all information on hostels in the context of educational organizations and regions.
      The ministry initiated amendments to the legislation on the expansion of academic and managerial independence of universities. For example, the Law on Education provides for additions that expand the competence of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan to approve the placement rules and methods for calculating the amount of government contracts for providing places in dormitories and, by definition, the operator of this project.
      "Now the preparations are proceeding to the active phase. If the amendments to the law are adopted by the parliament in August, then another month will go into the elaboration of the normative and legal acts of the ministry. By September 2019 we plan to hand over 5000 seats. This is our optimistic forecast," Assylova said.
      Answering the questions of journalists, Assylova noted that at present there are 204 thousand out of town students in the country, 101 thousand of them need dormitories.

      During an interview for the official site PrimeMinister.kz, vice minister of social development Zhuldyz Omarbekova told about plans for further work on holding the Year of Youth, in particular, about the emerging opportunities in education.

      As the vice minister noted, in Kazakhstan a lot is being done to support young people.
      “I would call Kazakhstan one of the most social states, because we give free secondary education to absolutely everyone, free technical education — for everyone. We have a lot of programs in the framework of employment: Youth Practice, Business Bastau and others. We have a very high per capita population of people with higher education,” said Omarbekova.
      In this regard, the vice minister advises young people to study more of these kinds of programs and get involved in them.
      Thus, the Roadmap for the Year of Youth provides for measures to increase the accessibility and quality of higher education.
      “First of all, we want to raise the level of all universities. In each region there must be at least one university that corresponds to the level of Nazarbayev University. So that people do not concentrate in megacities. Of course, everyone goes to Astana and Almaty, because there are the best universities there. The flagship universities should be in the west, and in the north, and in the east, and in the south of the country,” noted Omarbekova.
      In addition, special attention in the Roadmap is paid to equipping colleges and universities with hostels.
      “Last year, the Head of State within the framework of the Five Social Initiatives gave a corresponding instruction. We will take this work under special control. We will see that the infrastructure of our colleges and universities meets all international standards. A young man who lives in northern Kazakhstan or the Aktobe region should study at the same university with the same equipment as the students of Astana and Almaty,”noted Omarbekova.
      Also, the vice minister noted that the Roadmap provides for measures to fulfill the instructions of the Head of State to increase the availability of housing for young families in large cities. The ministry has already started the fulfillment of this task, the additional budget funds of the Government have been allocated. Omarbekova notes that family welfare issues depend on the availability of young people's own housing.
      “In order to support the young family and young people, the President gave instructions to build housing in the cities of Almaty, Astana, Shymkent. The Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development and local executive bodies will be the operators,” said the vice minister.
      In addition, the Head of State called on enterprises of all forms of ownership to take an active part in creating housing conditions for young employees.
      “Cadres decide everything. In any organization, be it a construction company or an opera house, it is very important to retain your personnel. You can hold if you build your hostel. Probably, within the framework of a public-private partnership, local executive bodies, together with enterprises and other organizations, will undertake this work. After all, this is not only the work of the state, it is a common work,” said Omarbekova.

      Unified National Testing in Kazakhstan will be held 4 times a year — in January, March, June, August. Testing is conducted on a fee basis, the cost is 2,242 tenge. According to the Ministry of Education and Science, the UNT format itself will not change in 2019.

      Participation in the UNT in January, March and August provides the applicant with the right to apply to higher education institutions for a paid department. A student who has passed the UNT in January can only claim to be enrolled in an higher educational institution on a commercial basis: it is enough for an applicant to score a passing grade. At the same time, it should be noted that after the UNT, those tested in January are not deprived of the opportunity to pass the main UNT in June and participate in the competition for the award of state educational grants.
      “Applicants applying for the state educational grant must necessarily pass the main UNT, which will be held in June-July 2019. To apply for participation in testing, it is necessary to contact the UNT national testing center at the place of residence,” the ministry’s materials read.
      The UNT format itself in 2019 will not change. The graduate traditionally passes three obligatory subjects (history of Kazakhstan, mathematics, reading literacy) and two corresponding specialized subjects.
      In January, March, the applicant can take the test at any convenient place for the UNT. To participate in testing, it is only necessary to submit an application at a specified time to the UNT paragraph.
      Recall from 2018, together with the UNT certificate, each graduate is given an information sheet with a list of groups of educational programs, the number of grants allocated, as well as the results of the last year's grant competition. This information sheet will help incoming when choosing their future profession.
      In order to expand the academic and managerial independence of universities, a number of changes have been adopted. Since 2019, a new classifier of training areas has been introduced. If earlier a classifier with a clear list of specialties acted in the country's universities, now the classifier will indicate areas of study, in accordance with which universities will independently develop educational programs.
      Thus, government grants will be distributed across groups of educational programs. For example, the group “Mathematics Teachers” includes such specialties as “Mathematics,” dual specialties “Mathematics-Physics,” “Mathematics-Informatics,” etc. In the group "Information Technologies" — "Informatics," "Information Systems," etc. That is, the distribution of state grants will be carried out among applicants not by specialties, but by groups of educational programs. After the grant is awarded, the applicant is enrolled in the university according to his chosen educational program and will be trained in the specialty he chooses when enrolling in the university.
      Unified National Testing — the system of assessment of graduates' knowledge, applied in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The UNT results are recognized by colleges, universities. The UNT scores are also important in awarding the Bolashak Presidential Scholarship.
      For the first time the UNT was introduced in 1999. Until 2017, the UNT performed 2 functions: the final exam, as the result of 11 years of schooling, and the entrance exam to the university, including as a mechanism for awarding state educational grants. Now the final certification or final exam is held in schools, and the UNT has become an entrance exam for universities and educational grants.
      The UNT is passed in one stage and is evaluated on a 140-point scale. Pupils in one day pass five subjects of which three are basic (mathematics, reading literacy, History of Kazakhstan) — 20 tasks for each and 30 tasks for each of the two specialized subjects.
      In 2019, the UNT will be held the 16th time. In general for 15 years, over 1.5 million school leavers have participated in the UNT. This represents 80% of their total number of high school graduates.

This will eliminate the imbalance between the level of preparation of children coming to study in the first grade, said Minister of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan Yerlan Sagadiyev at the press conference in the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

      Minister noted that with the introductiona single program and a single basic textbook in the first grade in 2016, teachers began to experience certain difficulties.

      In this regard, there was a need to introduce a single curriculum in the pre-school. It is expected that after the introduction of this innovation, children will come to the first grade as ready as possible for the development of a unified school curriculum.
      Zero grade can be studied both in school and in kindergarten.
      As for "Sauat ashu" textbook, it will be divided into two books: "Alippe" (ABC book) for the zero grade and "Ana tіlі" for the first. There is an alternative to zero grade - distance learning. The base program and the training course have already been posted on the site.

      About 25 thousand new teachers come to work annually. Now, we are focusing on increasing this number. Minister reported on the possible allocation of additional grants for PhD, Masters and Bachelor's degrees in pedagogical specialties in the amount of 3 thousand seats.

      In Address “Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Incomes and Quality of Life,” the Head of State paid great attention to the further development of the education system. President instructed to improve the quality of pre-school education and concentrate on implementation of the basic approaches of secondary education. Read the report by PrimeMinister.kz on how these orders are executed and what was done by the Ministry of Education and Science in 2018.

       
      Recall that in the Address to the people of Kazakhstan, the President noted that the foundations of thinking, mental and creative abilities, and new skills are formed in early childhood.
      Emphasis in education is shifting towards the 4C model: the development of creativity, critical thinking, communication skills and collaboration.
      As noted in the Ministry of Education and Science, in October 2018, the State obligatory standard of pre-school education and training was approved. The Standard provides for the development of social skills and self-learning skills for children.
      In addition, a program was developed and approved for the development of social skills and self-study skills, taking into account the requirements of the Standard, aimed at fulfilling the tasks of socializing children from birth to 3 years of age, developing social skills and self-study skills.
      There is an emphasis on the leading role of the teacher in the pre-school organization, of the parent — in the family and the pre-school organization.
      The main stages of the psychosocial development of the child’s personality from birth to 3 years of age are given in terms of the socialization of children.
      The program provides the formation of social skills in children on the interaction, adaptation, the formation of the child as an individual, humane attitude to the environment (family, society, nature), the basics of safe behavior. The assessment system will make it possible, using criteria (the child reproduces certain actions, understands what he does and applies independently what he can) to assess the levels of social readiness, leadership, tolerance and self-learning of children. As a result of the implementation of the Program, young children will develop social skills and self-study skills necessary for a successful, confident and positive future student.
       
       
      The Address refers to the final stage in the reforms of school education.
      In Kazakhstan, as part of the State Program for the Development of Education and Science for 2016-2019, the content is being updated. In the 2017-2018 school year, the program for the grades 1, 2, 5, 7 was updated. From Sep. 1, 2018, students in grades 3, 6, and 8 switched to the updated content.
      According to the ministry, today 73% of children are covered by the updated content of education (in 2016 — 12.6%, in 2017 — 43%). The coverage of teachers with courses on updated content for three years was 75%. Nearly 208 thousand teachers receive a surcharge for teaching on updated content.
      The updated curricula and textbooks were tested in the 2015-2016 academic year in the 1st grade, in the 2016-2017 academic year — in the 2nd, 5th and 7th grades, in the 2017-2018 — in the 3rd, 6th and 8th grades. From Sep. 1, 2018-2019 school year, testing continues for grades 4, 9 and 10 in 30 pilot schools. After each quarter, intermediate results are summarized. In 30 pilot schools, there are 143 class-kits.
      The overall result of the testing will be summarized at the end of the 2018-2019 school year.
      At the same time, a new model of per capita normative funding has been developed and is being tested to create a system for stimulating successful schools.
      The novelty of this model are:
      1. Determining the individual size of the per capita standard for children with special educational needs;
      2. Rationing of expenses for corresponding additional payments in order to ensure social guarantees of the state to employees living in zones of ecological disaster and radiation risk;
      3. Introduction of a component to improve the quality of education through the stimulation of pedagogical potential;
      4. Introduction of a corrective (downward) ratio for overcrowded schools with significant actual contingent in order to use public funds more efficiently and rationally;
      5. Regulating capital expenditures to improve the quality of education by strengthening and developing the material and educational base of schools.
      In general, the per capita standard is presented in 16 variations depending on the level of education and features of education (correctional classes, homeschooling, inclusive education).
      This model is tested in 43 schools in seven regions (Akmola, Aktobe, Almaty, East Kazakhstan, Turkestan regions, Astana and Almaty) and was evaluated by the Ministry of Finance, akimats, pilot schools, Atameken National Chamber of Entrepreneurs as more efficient and fair.
      To date, 80 state and 8 private schools in Astana have switched to per capita regulatory funding.
      Along with this, the state order is placed on the principle of per capita financing in private schools of six regions (cities of Astana and Shymkent, Aktobe, Almaty, Mangistau and Turkestan regions) for 6 thousand people.
      The ministry explains that to create the possibility of functioning of a number of schools with per capita funding in the form of a “state enterprise on the right of economic management,” changes were made to the legislation. This will contribute to the effective implementation of per capita regulatory financing of secondary education, creating conditions for the rational and effective use of budgetary funds.
      Intermediate results of approbation of per capita funding in pilot schools showed an improvement in the indicators of annual monitoring of student performance: from 54 points in 2013 to 61.9 points for the 2017-2018 academic year. The average UNT increased from 71 to 77.1 points. The share of students-winners, winners, laureates of competitions and competitions in the 2017-2018 academic year was 21.5% of the total number of students (in the 2012-2013 academic year — 18%).
      Within the scope of per capita funding, schools have the opportunity to partially strengthen the educational and material and technical base. Acquired: sports equipment, student furniture, training boards, visual aids and teaching materials, musical instruments.
       
       
      The basic content of the renewed education is implemented within the framework of the trilingual education policy. A systematic transition to learning in Kazakh, Russian and English is carried out as part of the 79th Step of the Nation’s Plan “100 Concrete Steps” and the State Program for the Development of Education and Science for 2016-2019. It was developed and approved an action plan for the promotion of trilingual education.
      In accordance with the Roadmap for the Development of Trilingual Education for 2015–2020, the natural science teaching (computer science, physics, chemistry and biology) in three languages ​​will be implemented in stages, starting from 2019 at the request of students and with the readiness of schools.
      For training in three languages, four natural-mathematical subjects are defined, which will be taught in English in high school — physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science.

      Today, multilingual education is successfully implemented in specialized schools of the Daryn network, Nazarbayev Intellectual School, in educational innovation lyceums and others.
      In 2018, the number of pilot schools that switched to teaching (fully and partially) of natural science subjects in English increased by 2.8 thousand. (in 2018 — 3,372, 2017 — 532). About 7.8 thousand teachers teach these academic subjects in English and 5.5 thousand teachers receive a surcharge of 200% of the basic salary.
      For three years, about 10 thousand teachers reached the level of proficiency in language B1 and higher for teaching natural science subjects in English.
      Advanced training courses on teaching in English were organized for 4,675 subject teachers starting in the new academic year.

      Opening the meeting, the President of Kazakhstan underscored that the issues of law enforcement and crime prevention are under his special control, the press service of Akorda reports.

      Nursultan Nazarbayev noted that over the last three years, owing to law enforcement agencies, the crime rate in the country has decreased by 17.5%.
      "People, first of all, go to the police for protection from crime. During the years of independence, 779 officers died, about two and a half thousand were wounded. And we must remember it. At the same time, the current state of the internal affairs bodies does not cater to the needs of society," the Head of State said.
      The President of Kazakhstan stressed that the existing standards of police relations with citizens went out of date and do not take into account real things.
      "Activity of law enforcement agencies fall short of the society’s expectations, giving rise to unfavourable criticism. People do not feel safe. Otherwise, we will fail to guarantee a high quality of life for the people of Kazakhstan, which is our main guideline. Therefore, we should immediately begin to reform the police," Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
      The Head of State pointed to the need of implementing meaningful and qualitative changes in the sphere of internal affairs in accordance with the directions of the current Address  to Kazakhstan’s Nation.
      In accordance with the agenda, the meeting heard the reports of Asset Issekeshev, Head of the Presidential Administration and Kalmukhanbet Kassymov, Minister of Internal Affairs.
      Taking into account the information provided, the President of Kazakhstan focused on the need for careful study of all planned activities.
      Giving notice to the importance of modern reform, the Head of State instructed to make effective the structure and staffing of the internal affairs bodies, as well as to exclude non-characteristic functions.
      "It is necessary to get rid of everything superfluous and increase focus on crime control and law enforcement. The links will be optimized, as a result of which there will be not five, but five subordinates per manager. The staff number fell by 10%. These measures will lead to a decrease in the number of police officers per capita from 471 to 424 per 100 thousand citizens, which is comparable to the average European level. At the same time, 16 billion tenge will be saved," Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
      In this regard, the President of Kazakhstan ordered to send the released funds to improve the system of labour remuneration and social protection of employees. Nursultan Nazarbayev also noted the need to conduct systematic work on finding additional internal reserves and eliminating inefficient administrative costs.
      "Additional 21.4 billion tenge will be allocated to increase the wages of the police. All that is the people's money. From the taxpayers' funds, we keep the police, the army, and the courts. Therefore, citizens demand that law enforcement agencies fulfil their duties properly," the Head of State said.
      The President of Kazakhstan also dwelt on the measures taken to solve the housing problems of employees directly involved in the fight against crime and the protection of public order. These measures will attract new qualified personnel to the most important policing sites and strengthen the units that perform functions of law enforcement and the fight against crime.
      The Head of State stressed that the dismissal of a police officer from service in law enforcement agencies for the offense committed would result in the loss of all benefits.
      "We need policemen of a new breed. The system of selection, training and promotion of personnel will be revised. Departmental education will undergo major changes. We need modern police academies, the quality of which must meet international standards," Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
      The President of Kazakhstan noted that out of 12 educational institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 5 of the best will remain; with the most qualified teachers selected, who will also receive higher salaries.
      "Acting police officers will undergo unscheduled certification. Only those who meet modern standards will remain. The most deserving will replace those who fail this exam. There are opportunities for quality selection in Kazakhstan - every year more than 20 thousand lawyers graduate from our universities," Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
      Along with this, the President of Kazakhstan demanded that the internal affairs bodies switch to a service model of work.
      "Every year more than 4.5 million citizens turn to the police, but the conditions for their admission have not been created. If a person comes with his misfortune, he should be promptly and politely received. But this is only half the battle. One should deal with his problem promptly and in accordance with the law. This is a modern format of work with the population," the Head of State said.
      Nursultan Nazarbayev instructed to create comfortable, technically equipped front offices with a convenient timetable.
      "The attitude of employees should exclude rudeness and neglect. When a citizen is a victim of a crime, or there is such a threat, he will not be able to live and work in peace until he is protected," the President of Kazakhstan said.
      Nursultan Nazarbayev also instructed to introduce new criteria for evaluating police activities.
      "Criteria should be objective, verifiable and reflect the quality performing police functions and evaluating the effectiveness of this work by the population. For this purpose, both statistical data of state bodies and sociological studies will be used. The trust of citizens, their comfort and safety will be the basis for assessing the effectiveness of the police. The pursuit of reporting indicators should be a thing of the past," the President of Kazakhstan said.
      In addition, the Head of State emphasized the importance of introducing digital technologies in ensuring public order.
      "It is necessary to universally introduce digital technologies into the work of internal affairs agencies. As indicated in the Address, all cities in Kazakhstan will be equipped with public safety monitoring systems. Services will be introduced to improve online feedback to the public. Modern technologies will cover all areas of policing," Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
      The President of Kazakhstan stressed that digitalization will help reduce corruption, as well as further streamline management units and staff size.
      The Head of State also pointed out the need to reform not only the police service, but also other structures of the Interior Ministry.
      "Important changes will affect the penitentiary system. Violent offenders will be kept separately from other convicts," the President of Kazakhstan said.
      President of Kazakhstan instructed to take measures to minimize crime in the streets and other public places.
      "People should be confident about their future, confident in safety and protection on the part of the state. Personal and property security of citizens counts for a great deal. This is the primary outcome measure of the police effectiveness," the Head of State concluded.

      Article of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev “Seven Facets of the Great Steppe” was published on the website of Akorda.

      Space is the measure of all things, time is the measure of all events. When the horizons of space and time merge, national history begins. And this is not just a beautiful aphorism.
      In fact, if you think about the history of the German, Italian or Indian people, the question of the relationship between the territory and the great achievements of these peoples during a thousand-year history quite rightly arises. Of course, Ancient Rome and modern Italy are not the same, but the Italians are justly proud of their roots. The ancient Goths and modern Germans are also not one and the same people, but they are all part of Germany’s vast historical heritage. Ancient India with its rich polyethnic culture and the modern Indian people are naturally considered as one unique civilization, continuing its development in an uninterrupted stream of history.
      And this is the right approach, allowing you to understand your origins, and indeed the entire national history in all its depth and complexity.
      The history of Kazakhstan should also be understood from the height of modern science, and not by its separate fragments. There are convincing arguments for this.
      , the majority of proto-state associations, the contribution of which will be discussed below, were formed on the territory of Kazakhstan, becoming one of the elements of the ethnogenesis of the Kazakh nation.
      , those outstanding cultural achievements that will be discussed were not brought into the steppe, but in most cases were born on our land and only then spread to the West and East, North and South.
      , the historical finds of the last decades clearly confirm the indissoluble connection of our ancestors with the most advanced technological innovations of their time and allow us to take a fresh look at the Great Steppe’s place in global history.
      Finally, the names of some Kazakh tribes and clans are many hundreds of years older than the ethnonym "Qazaq," which undoubtedly indicates a completely different horizon of national history than previously thought.
      The Eurocentric point of view did not allow to see the real fact that the Sakas, the Huns, the Proto-Turkic ethnic groups were part of the ethnogenesis of our nation.
      In addition, it is fundamentally important to note that we are talking about the history of Kazakhstan, which is common to many ethnic groups living on our territory for a long time. This is our common history, the contribution to which was made by many prominent figures of different ethnicity.
      Today we need a positive view of our own history. However, it should not be reduced to only the selective and opportunistic coverage of a particular historical event. Black is an inseparable companion of white. Together they form the unique color gamut of life of both an individual and whole nations. In our history there were many dramatic moments and tragedies, deadly wars and conflicts, socially dangerous experiments and political cataclysms. We have no right to forget about them. It is necessary to realize and accept your history in all its versatility and multidimensionality.
      The purpose is not to show one’s greatness by belittling the role of other nations. The aim is to calmly and objectively understand our role in global history, based on strict scientific facts.
      So, here are the seven facets of the Great Steppe.
      * * *
      Our land, without exaggeration, has become the place from where many objects of material culture originate. Much of that, without which the life of modern society is simply unthinkable, was once invented in our area. In their development, the inhabitants of the steppes opened to the world many technical innovations, became the forefathers of inventions, which are still used in all parts of the world. The chronicles preserve a lot of well-known facts, which show how the ancestors of the Kazakhs repeatedly changed the course of political and economic history over vast areas of Eurasia.
       
      Everyone knows that the Great Steppe gave the world horse breeding and the culture of horsemanship.
      For the first time, the domestication of horses by a human took place on the territory of modern Kazakhstan, as evidenced by excavations of the Botai settlement in the north of the country.
      The domestication of the horse gave our ancestors an unthinkable superiority at that time, and on the global scale made the biggest revolution in the economy and military affairs.
      However, the domestication of the horse marked the beginning of a culture of horsemanship. A rider on a horse, armed with a bow, lance or saber, became a symbol of the era when powerful empires created by nomadic peoples came to the forefront of history.
      The image of the equestrian standard-bearer is the most recognizable emblem of the heroic era and a special “cultural code” of the nomadic world, the formation of which is associated with the birth of horsemanship.
      The power of car engines is still measured in horsepower. And this long-standing tradition is a symbolic tribute to that great era when the horseman dominated the planet.
      We should not forget that humankind enjoyed the fruits of this great technological revolution right up to the XIX century, which came into the world from the ancient Kazakh land.
      The basic components of modern clothing go back to the ancient era of the steppe civilisation. The culture of horsemanship gave rise to optimal clothing for the rider-warrior. Striving for convenience and practicality during riding, our ancestors for the first time divided clothing into upper and lower parts. Therefore they invented the first types of trousers.
      This gave riders the freedom to ride and battle. Those that lived in the steppe sewed trousers from leather, felt, hemp, wool and flax. Over the past thousand years, this type of clothing has not changed fundamentally. Ancient trousers found during excavations have the same shape as modern ones.
      It is also known that today all the varieties of boots are the "successors" of soft shoes with a shaft and heel, which nomads used for riding.
      In an effort to improve the control of the horse while riding, the people of the steppe invented the high saddle and stirrups. Innovations allowed the rider to sit confidently on a horse and, even when moving quickly, to more efficiently use his weapon - a bow, a spear, a sword.
      Our ancestors brought to perfection archery at a gallop - it changed the design of the weapon: it became composite, more comfortable to use and more deadly, and the arrows got plumage and a metal tip, piercing armor.
      Another technological innovation introduced by the Turkic tribes that inhabited the territory of Kazakhstan was the invention of a saber, the distinctive feature of which was a straight or curved blade with a handle turned in the direction of the blade. These weapons became the most important and common in the arsenal of offensive weapons.
      Our ancestors were the first to create protective armor for the horse and the rider from armour plates. This led to the appearance of a heavily armed cavalry - the most important military innovation of the Eurasian nomads. Its evolution in the period from I millennium BC until the first century influenced the creation of a special kind of troops - heavy cavalry, which for a long time ensured an unprecedented military superiority of the steppe men, up to the invention and mass use of firearms.
       
      The invention of methods for producing metals opened a new historical era and forever changed the course of human development. The Kazakh land, rich in diverse metal ores, also became one of the first centres of establishment of metallurgy. The centres of mining production and smelting of bronze, copper, lead, iron, silver and gold, and the manufacture of sheet iron arose in the ancient antiquity on the lands of Central, Northern and Eastern Kazakhstan.
      Our ancestors constantly developed the production of new, more durable metals, which opened up opportunities for them to accelerate technological progress. This is evidenced by the furnaces found during the excavations, which were used to smelt metal, decorations, household items and weapons of earlier eras. This indicates a high technological development of the steppe civilizations that existed on our land in ancient times.
       
      Our ancestors lived in complete harmony with the outside world and considered themselves an inseparable part of nature. This key principle of being formed the worldview and values ​​of the peoples of the Great Steppe. The ancient inhabitants of Kazakhstan had a highly developed culture - they had their own writing and mythology.
      The most striking element of their heritage, a reflection of the artistic originality and richness of spiritual content is the "art of animal style." The use of images of animals in everyday life was a symbol of the interrelation of man and nature, pointing to the spiritual guides of the steppe people.
      They preferred images of predators, mostly felines. It is most likely not by chance that the snow leopard, a rare and noble representative of the local fauna, has become one of the symbols of sovereign Kazakhstan.
      At the same time, the animal style reflects the highest production skills of our ancestors - artistic carvings and the technique of working with metals are well known: the smelting and casting of copper and bronze, the methods for the complex manufacture of gold sheets.
      In general, the phenomenon of "animal style" is one of the highest peaks in world art.
       
      A sensational discovery for world science, which made it possible to take a fresh look at our origins, was the Golden Man, found in Kazakhstan in 1969 in Issyk, referred to in the circles of art scholars as “Kazakhstan’s Tutankhamun.”
      The warrior told us a lot. Our ancestors created the highest-level artistic creations that still amaze the imagination. Skillful golden guise of a warrior indicates confident mastery of the ancient masters of gold processing techniques. It also revealed a rich mythology, reflecting power and aesthetics of the Steppe civilization.
      So the steppe men exalted the personality of the leader, elevated him to the rank of a sun-like deity. The luxurious decoration of the burial introduced us to the intellectual traditions of the ancestors. On one of the silver cups found near the warrior, scribbled marks were found - traces of the oldest writing ever found in Central Asia.
       
      Altai is of great importance for the history of the Kazakhs and other peoples of Eurasia. From time immemorial, these majestic mountains not only decorated the lands of Kazakhstan, but were also the cradle of the Turkic peoples. It was here, in the middle of the 1
       millennium, where the Turkic world was born, and a new milestone was reached in the Great Steppe.
      History and geography formed a special model of continuity of the Turkic states, the great steppe empires. For centuries, they have successively replaced each other, leaving their significant mark in the economic, political and cultural landscape of medieval Kazakhstan.
      Having mastered the space within wide geographical boundaries, the Turkic peoples managed to create a symbiosis of nomadic and settled civilizations, which led to the flourishing of medieval cities, which became centres of art, science and world trade. For example, medieval Otyrar gave humanity one of the greatest minds of world civilization, Abu Nasr al-Farabi, while in Turkestan, Khoja Ahmet Yassawi, one of the great spiritual leaders of the Turkic peoples, lived and worked.
       
      The unique geographical location of Kazakhstan - in the very centre of the Eurasian continent - has contributed to the emergence of transit “corridors” between different countries and civilizations since ancient times. Starting from the turn of our era, these land routes were transformed into the Great Silk Road system - a transcontinental network of trade and cultural ties between East and West, North and South of Greater Eurasia.
      It has become a stable platform for the formation and development of the global interchange of goods and intellectual cooperation between nations.
      The key intermediaries of the most important trade route of antiquity and the Middle Ages, ensuring the flawless organisation and safety of transport arteries, were the inhabitants of the Great Steppe. The steppe belt connected the Chinese, Indian, Persian, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and Slavic civilizations.
      Since its inception, the Great Silk Road map has largely been located within the Turkic empires. It was during the rule of the Turkic peoples in Central Eurasia that the Great Silk Road reached its peak and promoted economic prosperity and cultural growth on an international scale.
       
      It is scientifically proven that the foothills of the Alatau are the "historic homeland" of apples and tulips. It is from here that these modest, but significant for the whole world plants gradually spread to all countries. And now Kazakhstan is the keeper of the progenitor of all the Earth’s apple trees — the Sievers apple tree. It was this tree that gave the world one of the most common fruits of our time. The apples that we know are the genetic varieties of the fruits of our apple tree species. On the ancient routes of the Silk Road from the foothills of the Trans-Ili Alatau on the territory of Kazakhstan, it ended up in the Mediterranean and then spread throughout the world. And as a symbol of this long history of the popular fruit, one of the most beautiful cities in the south of our country is called “Almaty”.
      Actually, here, in the Chu-Ili Mountains, we still see in its primal form pearls of Kazakhstan’s flora – the Regel tulips. These beautiful plants appeared on our land in the strip of deserts and foothills of the Tien Shan. From the Kazakh land, these modest but unusual flowers gradually spread around the world, conquering the hearts of many peoples with their beauty.
      Today there are more than 3 thousand varieties of cultivated tulips in the world, and most of them are “descendants” of our local flowers. In Kazakhstan, there are 35 types of tulips.
      * * *
      All these issues require serious thought. They relate to the fundamentals of our worldview, the past, present and future of the nation.
      I believe that we can begin this work with several large projects.
       
      During the years of independence, a lot of work has been done to study the past of our people — the “Cultural Heritage” programme was successfully implemented, which allowed restoring the forgotten fragments of the historical chronicle. However, many documented evidence about the life of ancestors and their unique civilization has not yet been introduced into scientific circulation and are waiting for their hour in numerous archives around the world.
      Therefore, I believe that we need to create the seven-year programme “Archive-2025,” which would include serious fundamental research of all domestic and foreign archives, starting with antiquity and ending with modernity.
      As part of its implementation, it is necessary to focus the research work of special groups of historians, archivists, and cultural scientists on systemic and long-term engagement with domestic and major foreign archives.
      This important activity in all respects should not turn into “academic tourism” at the public expense. It is necessary not only to painstakingly collect archived data, but also to actively convert it into a digital format, making it available to all interested experts and the general public.
      Raising a sense of pride in one’s history, fostering patriotism must begin at school. Therefore, it is important to create a historical and archaeological movement at schools and local history museums in all regions of the country. Being familiar with the national history creates the feeling of unity of their origins among all the people of Kazakhstan.
       
      It is known that the historical process in the mass consciousness is primarily personified. Many nations are deservedly proud of the names of great ancestors who have become the unique ambassadors of their countries.
      For example, such world-famous personalities of bygone eras as Tutankhamun, Confucius, Alexander the Great, Shakespeare, Goethe, Pushkin and George Washington are today invaluable “symbolic capital” for "their states," contributing to their effective promotion in the international arena.
      The Great Steppe also spawned a whole galaxy of prominent figures. Among them are such large-scale figures as Al-Farabi and Yassawi, Kul-Tegin and Beibars, Tauke and Abylay, Kenesary and Abay and many others.
      Therefore, we should, first of all, create an educational Park-Encyclopedia "The Great Names of the Great Steppe," where, under the open sky, sculptural monuments in honour of our famous historical figures and their achievements will be presented.
      Secondly, by organising a targeted state order, it is necessary to initiate the formation of a topical gallery of images of great thinkers, poets and rulers of the past in contemporary literature, music, theater, and visual arts.
      In addition to the classic formats, it is also important to tap the creative potential of alternative youth art. This work can involve not only domestic, but also foreign masters of art and creative teams.
      Thirdly, it is necessary to systematise and step up activities for the creation and dissemination of the popular science series “Outstanding personalities of the Great Steppe” — “Uly Dala Tulgalary,” covering a broad historical horizon.
      In this direction, international multidisciplinary teams can be created, in which, along with Kazakh scientists, foreign specialists will be involved. As a result, the life and activities of our heroes will be known both in our country and abroad.
       
      Kazakhstan, the ancestral homeland of the Turkic peoples, is the sacred "Kara Shanyrak." From here, from our steppes, the Turkic tribes and peoples who made a significant contribution to the historical processes in other countries and regions went to different parts of the world.
      We need to launch the project “Turkic civilization: from the beginnings to the present,” within which it is possible to organise the World Congress of Turkologists in Astana in 2019 and the Days of Culture of the Turkic ethnic groups, where the ancient Turkic artifacts will be displayed in the museums of various countries. It is also important to create a single online library of common Turkic works following the example of Wikipedia, of which Kazakhstan can act as a moderator.
      In addition, as part of the promotion of Turkestan as a new regional centre, it is necessary to strengthen its positioning in the international arena.
      The ancient capital of Kazakhstan is not only the spiritual centre of our people, but also a sacred place for the entire Turkic world.
       
      We have every opportunity to create the Museum of Ancient Art and Technology of the Great Steppe “Uly Dala.” It is possible to collect samples of high art and technology, including artefacts made in animal style, the decoration of the "Golden Man," objects reflecting the process of taming the horse, the development of metallurgy, the manufacture of weapons, equipment and other artifacts. Expand in it the exposition of valuable archaeological finds and archaeological complexes found on the territory of Kazakhstan, which reflect the development process of various sectors of the economy on the territory of our country in certain historical eras.
      And also create the National Club of Historical Reconstructions "Great Civilizations of the Great Steppe" and hold festivals in Astana and the regions of Kazakhstan on its basis: the ancient Saks, Huns, the era of the great Turkic Kagans, etc. Work on these topics can be done simultaneously, bringing together those interested in these subjects.
      The tourist project for the partial restoration of the ancient city of Otyrar with the reconstruction of objects of the urban environment — houses, streets, public places, water supply, city walls, and so on — will be interesting.
      At the same time, it is necessary to focus on the popularisation of knowledge and the development of tourism on this basis.
       
      Within the framework of this project, we need to create an “anthology of steppe folklore.” It will contain the best examples of verbal folk art by the heirs of the Great Steppe over the past millennium — tales, legends, stories, epics.
      In addition, it is necessary to release a collection of "Ancient motifs of the Great Steppe" — a collection of significant works created for traditional Kazakh musical instruments: kobyz, dombra, sybyzgy, sazsyrnay and others.
      The folklore and melodies of the Great Steppe should acquire a “new breath” in a modern digital format. To work on these projects, it is important to attract domestic and foreign professionals who are able not only to systematise, but also to actualise the rich heritage of the Steppe.
      The main plots, characters and motives of our culture have no boundaries and should be systematically researched and promoted throughout the whole of Central Eurasia and in the whole world.
      Modernisation of verbal and musical traditions should acquire formats that are close and comprehensible to the modern audience.
      In particular, ancient words and texts may be accompanied by illustrations or be embodied in the form of vivid video materials. In turn, sounds and melodies can be born not only by means of authentic instruments, but also through modern electronic versions.
      In addition, it is necessary to organise a series of scientific and research expeditions to various regions of Kazakhstan and other countries to search for common historical foundations of the folklore tradition.
       
      In the modern world, cinema occupies a huge place in the self-education of peoples in historical subjects. Bright film images sometimes play a more significant role in mass public perceptions than documentary portraits in scientific monographs.
      Therefore, in the near future it is necessary to launch into production a special cycle of documentary films, television series and feature-length movies that demonstrate the continuity of the civilizational history of Kazakhstan.
      Work on these projects should be carried out within the framework of broad international cooperation involving the best domestic and foreign scriptwriters, directors, actors, producers and other specialists in the modern film industry.
      In addition, it is necessary to maximise the use of genre of the new historical television and film productions, by including elements of fantasy and action-packed blockbusters that are popular today with the audience, as well as adventure and melodramatic motifs.
      For this purpose, it is possible to use the rich mythological and folklore material of the Great Steppe.
      Particular attention should also be paid to the younger generation, which is in dire need of high-quality children's films and animated series that can create a cult of national superheroes.
      Our illustrious warriors, thinkers and rulers deserve to be role models not only in Kazakhstan, but throughout the world.
       
      A year and a half ago, I published the article “Course towards the future: modernisation of Kazakhstan’s identity,” which found a broad response in society.
      I consider the above projects as a continuation of the programme “Rouhani Zhangyru.”
      The new components of the nationwide programme “Rouhani Zhangyru” will make it possible to bring to reality the centuries-old heritage of our ancestors, making it understandable and in demand in the current conditions of the digital civilization.
      I am convinced that the people who remember, appreciate, and are proud of their history have a great future. Pride in the past, a pragmatic assessment of the present and a positive outlook into the future — this is the key to the success of our country.

      The Head of State has learned about the results of the pilot project on introducing Smart City modern technologies, implemented within the framework of Digital Kazakhstan state program.
      Noting the importance of the conducted work, the President of Kazakhstan underscored that the projects realized in the field of digitalization are primarily focused on improving the quality of life, creating a comfortable and safe environment for citizens.

      The Unified National Test will be divided into two stages: the final examination - both GCSE and UNT - as the entrance examination to the universities.

      "Ministry of Education and Science conducted a sociological poll, which was attended by about 10 thousand teachers, parents, alumni, and NGOs. The survey results revealed significant problems of the current format of the UNT. The experience of the UNT has shown that the public perceives this procedure only as an entrance exam to university. The final certification function is not fully implemented from the first year of introduction of UNT. The number of participants has never been a perfect match. The number of not participating in UNT reaches almost 30%. This means that the results of the UNT can not draw conclusions about the quality of secondary education in Kazakhstan," deputy chairman of the Control Committee in the sphere of education and science of MES of Kazakhstan Nurbek Orshubekov said during the press conference at CCS.
      According to him, in this regard, the Ministry carried out work in two areas: the separation of the final exams and UNT as the entrance to universities and, therefore, how the system of awarding state grants; the structure of the UNT.
      "As a result, the Ministry decided to divide the UNT into two stages: final examination - both GCSE and UNT - as the entrance examination to the universities. Final certification will be carried out in schools in five subjects, including 4 compulsory and 1 by choice. These examinations are held in all schools for today – the exams are taken by those who did not go to the UNT. Therefore, there is nothing especially new. All teachers and students are familiar with the procedures. The change is that if earlier questions were prepared by regional offices of education, now the test questions will be prepared by the National Testing Center," N. Orshubekov has said.
      In addition, the school will assign a sign "Altyn Belgi". Confirmation of "Altyn Belgi" on the UNT is not required.

      The President of Kazakhstan noted the key role of the Government in the process of forming and controlling tariffs in the energy services market.
      "Every year at a Government meeting, the Ministry of Energy reported on the need for rate reduction. The Prime Minister and the Government have taken no action in this regard. I instruct everyone to deal with that. The whole chain of responsible governmental departments should be under the auspices of the ministry, or the Government itself should coordinate the process," Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
      In turn, Kanat Bozumbayev informed the Head of State on the results of the work carried out on establishing marginal tariffs for the generation of electrical energy at the stations.
      "In the first ten days of December, there will be price negotiations, the results of which will determine the tariff for capacity. And in the first ten-day interval, based on that we will approve the marginal tariffs for electric energy. They will be differentiated according to different types of stations. But all of them will be reduced from 5 to 20 percent on average, depending on the type of stations," the Energy Minister said.
      During the meeting, it was noted that work was needed on the part of the Committee on regulating natural monopolies, protecting competition and consumer rights under the National Economy Ministry to reduce the tariffs of regional stations and energy supply organizations.

As a result, the activity of NGOs today covers almost all significant spheres of our society,” Nursultan Nazarbayev stated.
      Pointing to significance of involving the non-governmental sector in key areas of social policy, the Head of State instructed to take measures to ensure the transparency of procedures for financing NGO projects.
      "To this end, I am instructing the Government, as part of digitalization process, to create a unified electronic register of verification of NGOs. In it, non-governmental organizations will get registered on a voluntary basis, posting the necessary materials that will allow forming NGO ratings to ensure their access to funding," the President of Kazakhstan said.
      In addition, Nursultan Nazarbayev drew attention to the need to create an effective mechanism of civilian control, in which the key role will be assigned to the Civil Alliance of Kazakhstan.
      "We should proceed with transferring state functions to the non-governmental sector. In this area, projects can be implemented in the field of ecology, social work, protection of children’s rights and other areas. I propose to the Government and the Ministry of Social Development to study in detail all the voiced proposals for their practical implementation," the Head of State said.
      The event also noted the need for active participation of NGOs in the evaluation process and ensuring public oversight of carrying out the governmental programs. In this regard, the Government was instructed to develop a Concept for the civil society development before 2025.

      Along with that, Nursultan Nazarbayev ordered to take measures to expand programs to support the volunteer movement. The Head of State stressed that holding Expo-2017 and the XXVIII Winter Universiade showed the relevance of such activities.
      "NGOs’ partaking in creating a proactive environment for people with disabilities, children and young people with special needs is positive. The development of an inclusive society is the world’s practice and one of the key social tasks accomplished through civil society in all developed countries," the President of Kazakhstan emphasized.
      The Head of State noted the importance of further implementing Rouhani Zhangyru Program and starting work within the framework of priorities identified in the new article titled “Seven Faces of the Great Steppe”. The President of Kazakhstan stressed the need to involve NGOs in the process of implementing the areas and projects identified in it.
      "Akims of cities and regions need to introduce a system of providing services to the population in open barrier-free spaces on the principle of a single window using digital technologies," Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
      In conclusion, the Head of State charged the Government with shaping the concrete action plan following the proposals voiced during the Civil Forum and providing for the participation of all interested government bodies.

      The meeting has discussed the issues of further modernization of the judicial system in accordance with the identified priorities in the current Address to Kazakhstan’s Nation, the press service of Akorda reports.

      "Court’s credibility is the state’s credibility. In this regard, there has been considerable work as part of the Nation's Plan titled '100 Specific Steps.' Improving the judicial system is an important aspect of modernizing our economy and enhancing the social well-being of citizens," Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
      During the meeting, there were reports of Head of the Presidential Administration Asset Issekeshev, Chairman of the Supreme Court Zhakip Asanov and Chairman of the Supreme Judicial Council Talgat Donakov on the results of the work of the working group on judicial system modernization commissioned by the Head of State.
      The President of Kazakhstan instructed to take appropriate measures to address complex issues in the judicial system. In particular, the judicial load has increased over the past three years by 2 times.
      "Per one working day, a judge is to conduct four meetings, make the same decisions and make 150 sanctions. Naturally, there is a question of quality. Thirty percent of these cases do not require legal proceeding," Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
      The Head of State instructed to undertake steps towards reducing the caseload, simplifying the civil process, rising efficiency and transparency of legal proceedings in the country.
      "One of the important issues is the quality of judicial personnel, their degree of preparation and adaptation to modern economic realities, which require a completely different approach. Legally illiterate judges will not help us carry out reforms. Judges must be models of competence, honesty, fairness and decency," the President of Kazakhstan said.
      Nursultan Nazarbayev stressed that today the selection procedure for judges has been tightened. Thus, only 5 applicants out of 100 were able to pass the exam for the position of a judge. Such requirements were put forward to attract highly qualified lawyers competent in handling complex cases to the judicial work. Appropriate conditions will be created for such experts, including decent wages.
      "I appeal to the judges who swore. Oath should be a guide to action, not layperson’s terms. Wages and provision of a judge are paid from the taxpayers’ money. Therefore, judges should show effective work. The punishment for a judge who violated the law should be the most severe," the Head of State stressed.
      Nursultan Nazarbayev instructed to transfer the full range of personnel issues from the Supreme Court to the Supreme Judicial Council. Career promotion of judges should depend solely on their professionalism and decency.
      The President of Kazakhstan ordered to work out a draft law aimed at the qualitative renewal of judicial personnel and submit it to the Parliament.
      In accordance with the Constitutional Law “On Judicial System and Status of Judges in Kazakhstan,” there is professional assessment of 470 judges in 2019. In this regard, the Head of State instructed the Supreme Court and the Supreme Judicial Council to ensure objectivity in this matter.
      "We will be able to modernize the judicial system in the event that there is strong trust in judges in society. Our ultimate goal is independent and incorruptible judiciary. Assessment of courts will be carried out not only by statistical methods, but also by conducting independent sociological research. Judges should understand that the assessment will be based on how honestly they work and inspire confidence. Based on strict adherence to legislation, prompt and transparent justice is in the basic interests of society and the country's strategic development course," Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
      The Head of State also commissioned the development of new formats in legal proceedings and functioning of e-services, as well as to ensure creation of front offices in court buildings.
      Control over actualizing the tasks has been assigned to the Presidential Administration. Particular attention should be paid to such aspects as the quality and timeliness of considering cases, as well as the satisfaction of citizens.

      Statement by the Head of State on the completion of the humanitarian operation to evacuate the citizens of Kazakhstan from Syria was published on the official website of Akorda.

      Jan. 6, 2019, as a result of a humanitarian operation carried out by our law enforcement agencies and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 47 citizens of Kazakhstan including 30 children, were evacuated from Syria. They were fraudulently taken to this country where they were held hostage by terrorists. Upon arrival in Kazakhstan, women and children were given all possible assistance from the state. These innocent people who found themselves in such a difficult situation were immensely glad for their salvation. Within a month they will undergo an adaptation period and receive necessary medical care. The efforts made will help prevent such incidents.
      Kazakhstan always supports its citizens, regardless of their location. Our main task is to ensure security, protect the integrity and unity of the country. We will continue to work on returning the children who are in the combat zone against their will.

      The text of the statement is available on the website of Akorda.

      "Dear Kazakhstanis!
      Today, I am taking a decision of major importance for our country.
      In previous years, Kazakhstan’s socioeconomic situation has been stable. 
      That is certainly positive.
      However, that is not good enough at present.
      The Third Modernization and Plan of the Nation - 100 Specific Steps which I initiated, focused on accelerating the implementation of structural reforms.
      The full implementation of the Five Institutional Reforms was meant to lead to an increase in small and medium businesses and a decrease in the state’s participation in the economy. These Reforms were also meant to lead to a “cleaning-up” of banks, as well as building trust in our nation’s courts and our law enforcement system.
      Across major sectors of the economy, despite adopted laws and government decisions, these improvements have not materialized.
      GDP growth has predominantly been achieved due to the extraction of primary resources.
      The Government in conjunction with the National Bank, have failed to fully build up enough momentum and develop the tools needed for meaningful growth in the economy.
      An analysis of the implementation of state programs shows that they are underway, but that no results have been achieved in many important areas.
      There is an inadequate availability of meaningful jobs, especially in rural regions. Small and medium businesses have not turned into the drivers of growth; their development has not been the primary mission of akims and ministers.
      I have continually instructed that the improvement of incomes and living standards should be top priorities for each member of the Government and akim.
      Two years ago, we carried out constitutional reforms, and the Government in collaboration with the akims obtained the authority and independence needed to solve social and economic issues, and bear responsibility for that.
      The necessary government programs have been adopted, including industrial and social programs, infrastructure development, and health and education reform. All the resources required have been allocated for their attainment.
      At the same time, work at the governmental level has not been organized effectively. Real earnings of Kazakh citizens are flatlining. The share of food expenses in a family’s budget is increasing.
      Because of the bureaucratic approach of the executive bodies, sections of socially vulnerable groups are not covered by targeted social assistance.
      These issues are fuelled by the inefficiency of Government members - ministers and akims - to work with the population, to listen to people's problems, and to inform them of the work undertaken and the policies carried out.
      Under these circumstances, I, as President and Protector of the Constitution, having our nation’s best interests at heart, am carrying out the following resolution.
      I believe that the Government should resign.
      The new Government’s leadership should take effective steps focused on raising living standards, stimulating the economy, and fulfilling the strategic tasks.
      At the forthcoming Nur Otan Party congress, I will propose a series of actions to strengthen the social safety net and improve quality of life.
      Significant resources from the budget and the National Fund will be allocated for these purposes.
      They will be applied towards fulfilling the following tasks:
      1. Strengthening social assistance for financially disadvantaged citizens;
      2. Broadening options for improved housing for vulnerable social groups;
      3. Enacting meaningful change in the development policy of the regions.
      The activities of the Government and akims of all levels should be focused towards the implementation of these tasks.
      Funds that are available to the Government and at a local level are being improperly spent. There will be control over all these things. A thorough discussion on this matter will take place at the Nur Otan Party congress," the statement reads.

In accordance with the Loan Rules, no less than 20% of the amount of funds allocated should be allocated for financing start-up projects.
      Zhandar Omarov noted that last year under the Program, 5694 projects were financed for the amount of 19.3 billion tenge. Including on launch projects, there were 3426 projects worth 11.5 billion tenge. That is, about 60% was allocated to start-up projects, thereby 20% threshold level was exceeded.

      Deputy of the Prime Minister - Minister of Agriculture Askar Myrzakhmetov held a meeting with the Minister of Agriculture and Environment of the Republic of Serbia Branislav Nedimovic.

      During the meeting the sides discussed the main directions and further prospects of bilateral cooperation between Kazakhstan and Serbia in the field of agriculture.
      The parties noted that there is great potential for its development. If Kazakhstan is the corridor for Serbia to enter the China market, then Serbia to Kazakhstan is a window to Europe.
      "Earlier, the leaders of our countries have been designated priority areas for our cooperation. One of them is agriculture. As it is known, Kazakhstan as a leader in the production of grain and flour, has great potential in the development of livestock, meat and milk production. It should be noted that Serbia has made significant progress in the field of organic agriculture. In this direction, we can achieve more together," A.Myrzakhmetov said.
      Serbia is the largest producer of corn and wheat. Production of sugar beet and sunflower seeds satisfy the domestic demand for sugar and vegetable oil. Production of fruits, berries, and viticulture is highly developed.
      In turn, Kazakhstan is interested in cooperation on the exchange of experience in the development of organic agriculture, joint research in the field of variety testing, improving the genetic potential of crops, fruits and berries, the establishment of contacts between agricultural research institutes of Kazakhstan and Serbia.
      "By order of the Head of State there is a task to produce environmentally friendly products. In this regard, we plan to work closely with Serbia, which has achieved certain results in this field. The State program of development of agro-industrial complex of Kazakhstan for 2017-2021 also considers that. We are ready to send a working group for a thorough examination of this issue," A.Myrzakhmetov said.
      The Serbian side has supported every proposal, and the Kazakh side expressed its readiness to free trade with linkages to Europe.

      Earlier, the head of state stressed that the issues of the agricultural sector require careful consideration. The priorities of the State program of development of agriculture should be an increase in production volumes, increased productivity, diversification of agricultural production, reducing food imports, increasing exports of processed products and agricultural cooperation development.
      In response to the request, Ministry of Agriculture has prepared a draft of National Agribusiness Development Programme for 2017-2021, which was discussed in the Parliament and the Government of Kazakhstan.
      Combining private farms into cooperatives is a major conceptual approach of state program that will lead to a balanced and sustainable development of the country, increase productivity and improve living standards of the general population.

      The program aims to involve more than 500 thousand smallholdings and small commodity production in the BCH and to create more than 1,200 agricultural cooperation by 2021.
      Cooperatives will provide its members with veterinary services, agrochemicals, forage, slaughtering, milk collection, product storage and distribution logistics. For example, the villagers for their cattle need hay. When the cost of 7-8 thousand tenge per ton, it is sold for 20 thousand in summer, for 30 thousand tenge in autumn, for 40-50 thousand tenge in winter. A cooperative, taking the support of the state to lease the tractor, mower, trailer can provide the villagers with hay at cost, as well as co-operatives, in a word, we must address all the issues that are hindering the development of production factors for smallholders and small-scale farms, centrally will supply the mixed fodder villagers through his little preparation center.
      It is planned to create a focused export policies as part of the state program. The main measure to promote domestic agricultural products to foreign export markets will be carried out under a single umbrella brand that will enable an accelerated pace to win the trust of overseas markets.

      Deputy of Prime Minister - Minister of Agriculture Askar Myrzakhmetov continued advocacy of the concept of the State program of agro-industrial complex development for 2017-2021 to the population of the main grain-producing regions of the country.

      The farmers, entrepreneurs from Akmola, Kostanai and North Kazakhstan regions participated during cluster meeting to explain the state program of the AIC development.
      "At the government meeting as of September 9 this year, the President instructed the Government to develop the State program of AIC on the basis of " Agribusiness-2020" Programme before the end of the year. According to the head of state, agriculture will be the driver of Kazakhstan’s economy," A.Myrzakhmetov said.
      It is worth mentioning the fact that Kazakhstan meets the 25th anniversary of Independence with a record harvest. Agriculture took the lead on the socio-economic development for the first time for the 9 months, ahead of industries. And all this thanks to the hard work of farmers.
      During the meeting, A.Myrzakhmetov spoke about the goals and objectives of the concept of the state program of agrarian and industrial complex development.
      Ministry of Agriculture analyzed the state of agriculture in Kazakhstan within the concept of state program of agrarian and industrial complex development.
      Thus, the analysis shows that the livestock industry production and processing of fish, poultry, sausages, cheese, cottage cheese, butter at a low level, respectively, imports of these products is high (from 33 to 67%).
      Mutton, beef is produced in sufficient quantities and there is potential to increase exports.
      There is a high proportion of imports of pasta, vegetable oil, canned vegetables, and sugar in the crop sector.
      "In the course of our analysis, we see that there is overproduction of wheat, the lack of production of animal feed, barley, poultry, low share of processed meat, milk, vegetables, and low level of exports of beef, lamb," the head of the Ministry of Agriculture informed.
      According to A. Myrzakhmetova, the above problems have led to a negative balance of foreign trade (exports of agricultural products amounted to 2.1 billion dollars in 2015, the import - 3.4 billion dollars).
      One of the objectives of the State program will be to increase rural incomes and to ensure the production of marketable products at competitive agribusiness markets.
      The main objectives of the program will be developed by the State: improving the efficiency of livestock by 58% and crop by 40%; the development of large-scale agricultural cooperation to involve 670 thousand smallholders in commercial production and create an effective marketing system and processing.; ensuring the efficiency and availability of state with maximum coverage of agricultural producers; implementation of targeted export policy and promotion of Kazakhstan's brand of organic products; involvement in the turnover of more than 600 thousand hectares of irrigated land; improvement of state regulation of agro-industrial complex.

      Deputy Prime Minister of Kazakhstan - Minister of Agriculture of Kazakhstan Askar Myrzakhmetov held an expanded board meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture in the selector mode, during which a number of tasks set by the Head of State and Prime Minister of Kazakhstan have been discussed.

      First, the National Agribusiness Development Program is developing on the basis of the current "Agribusiness 2020" government program  .
      In particular, the program will be in the state format, and therefore a number of adjustments to agribusiness subsidies are planned. In crop farming it concerns the diversification of the structure of sown areas, primarily wheat. The livestock will cover small and medium-sized farms, which are associated with lower risk, primarily to ensure the feed, and the use of transhumance potential.
      Second, a number of measures to ensure rural employment and reloading processing capacity of enterprises through the use of the potential of private farms in the agricultural cooperatives are under implementation to develop mass entrepreneurship.
      "For three years, it is planned to involve in commodity agricultural production 226 thousand smallholders, to create more than 70 thousand permanent jobs and increase the load of the processing enterprises, at least 20%," sets the task the Ministry of Agriculture.
      According to the ministry, 448 agricultural cooperatives have been already created for today. Currently, work is underway to eliminate the presence on the land requirements for the application of a special tax regime for agricultural cooperatives.
      Third, consider allocation of 10 acres for individual housing construction in the framework of "Nurly zher" program.
      To address this issue, it is planned to amend the Land Code concerning allocation to mayoral offices the purchase of land plots for individual housing construction for public use.
      Thus, to organize the waiting lists and the exclusion of cases of double free provision of land plots for individual housing construction, it is planned to create Single Registration Waitlist on "electronic government" web-portal and to automate the sequence assignment process.
      Fourth, the Ministry allocated additional funding in the amount of 97.3 billion tenge this year to support agrarian industrial complex, to increase production efficiency.
      Currently, the task of the Ministry is to ensure the timely and effective development of the allocated budgetary funds.
      Also, issues of expansion of irrigated areas by 600 thousand ha and the restoration of its infrastructure was discussed.
      Fifth, the epizootic situation in the country in particularly dangerous animal diseases remained stable in 2016, with the exception of isolated outbreaks of acute and chronic infections.
      "95 foci especially dangerous animal diseases registered since the beginning of 2016, 42 of them were liquidated and closed by the decision of IOI. The remaining 53 outbreaks conducted veterinary and quarantine measures according to the instructions. In addition, recreational activities are carried out in 109 places of disadvantaged brucellosis," the Ministry informs.
      For example, it is planned to hold 135,500,000 planned manipulations in 2016. For 7 months of 2016, 76.6 million planned manipulations were carried out, 73.1 million were performed, representing 95.4% of the plan for 7 months.
      Summing up, A.Myrzakhmetov gave instructions on improvement of agro-industrial complex of Kazakhstan and noted that these orders will be under special control.

      Today the Minister of Agriculture, Askar Myrzakhmetov held a reporting meeting with the locals in the Karaganda region. The meeting was attended by agricultural producers, trade unions and associations, members of the Public Council, representatives of central and local executive bodies. 

      During the meeting, the minister spoke about the results of the industry development in 2016 and the ministry's tasks for the current year. Thus, the volume of gross agricultural output in 2016 amounted to 3.6 trillion tenge, an increase of 5.5%. At the same time, production growth for the first time in 10 years is provided by all regions. 
      Investments in the fixed capital of agriculture increased 1.5 times - from 164 to 253 billion tenge. 
      In order to achieve the objectives set in the President's Address, in February 2017 a new State Program for the Development of the AIC was approved, the main priorities of which are saturation of the domestic market and development of the export potential of domestic products, maximum involvement of small and medium-sized farms in agricultural cooperation, efficient use of water resources and development trade logistic infrastructure. 
      65 types of subsidies were revised, 11 ineffective subsidies were excluded, 40 criterias were changed, and the remaining 14 were left unchanged. As a result, it is expected that about 25 billion tenge will be saved annually. And the changed criteria will increase the production of agricultural products by an average of 29% within the same budget. 
      In the current year, within the framework of the State Program for the Development of the Agro-industrial Complex, diversification of crop areas began. To this end, memorandums between the Ministry and the Akimats have been developed and signed, which provide for the expansion of the areas of oilseeds and fodder, cereals and grain crops, as well as sugar beet for a total area of about 930,000 hectares this year. 
      In addition, for the first time the final rate for loans for spring field works has been reduced to 6% per annum for final borrowers, while last year it was 9%. This is achieved by reducing the number of links in the chain of credit. In addition, the required package of documents on loan products has been significantly reduced. 
      Since this year, the production of original and elite seeds has been resumed. The amount of budget funds allocated to support seed production this year exceeds the level of the previous year by more than 3 times. The minimum standards have been abolished, which will allow farmers to be interested in receiving subsidies, since under the old scheme a small amount was subsidized. 
      For the first time in recent years fertilizer application reaches 14% of the demand. Earlier, the application of fertilizers did not exceed 10% on average. The revision of the mechanisms for subsidizing mineral fertilizers made it possible to increase the volume of their application by 1.5 times. If earlier the subsidy rate was set in percentage terms, then from the current year - in absolute figures. This allowed farmers to choose fertilizers for quality and price regardless of the country of origin and expand the range of fertilizers used. This year, the types of subsidized fertilizers were 156, in 2016 there were 85 types. 

      In livestock breeding, the changed criteria allowed to increase the coverage of subsidy recipients several times within the same funds. If earlier subsidies for beef received 175 farms, then today - 522, milk coverage increased from 269 to 532, for mutton - from 180 to 234, for wool - from 50 to 180 farms. Also, the subsidizing of mutton was replaced by the more popular lamb. 
      In connection with the underloading of existing wool processing enterprises, it is envisaged to subsidize not only fine, but also semi-thin wool. One of the main approaches in the implementation of the State Program for the
      Development of the Agro-industrial Complex is the involvement of small and medium-sized farms in agricultural cooperation. 
      "In the establishment of the agro-industrial complex the new driver of the country's economy, agricultural cooperatives are of great importance, because they have a huge potential for the development of the industry and the village. Cooperation is the future of the village", A. Myrzakhmetov said. 
      To unite agricultural producers in all 160 rural areas, seminars were conducted in 2,248 akims of rural districts and district akim deputies were trained, a free one-stop call center and 
       portal were created for consultations on cooperation issues, a scheme for purchasing modular milk receiving and slaughtering stations without collateral and initial Contribution for agricultural co-operatives, as well as for members of cooperatives, a mechanism for guaranteeing loans is provided. 
      52 billion tenge was allocated for support of agricultural cooperation this year, including 27 billion tenge under the productive employment program and 25 billion tenge through the Fund for Financial Support of Agriculture. If the State Program planned to establish 326 cooperatives in 2017, now it is planned to increase their number to 467. 
      As of May 30, 286 cooperatives have been registered, including 102 for milk procurement, 181 for meat production and harvesting. The family fattening grounds for 20 136 heads of cattle and 51 greenhouses have been created. Over 40,000 private households and small farms are involved in commodity production of agricultural products. 
      Great attention is paid to the issues of veterinary and phytosanitary security. So, on May 25, 2017 Kazakhstan got the status of a zone free of FMD for the remaining 5 regions (East Kazakhstan region, South Kazakhstan region, Almaty, Zhambyl, Kyzylorda regions). This gives a good opportunity to increase the export of animal and vegetable products. 
      In the field of phytosanitary in the current year, the projected volumes of treatment for especially dangerous pests are 4.8 million hectares, including 1.6 million hectares for herd locusts. 
      To date, 500 thousand hectares processed against the Moroccan locust in the South Kazakhstan and Zhambyl regions, which exceeds the current plan by 180 thousand hectares. 
      As part of the fulfillment of the instructions of the Head of State to increase the volume of export of agricultural products of the Ministry of Agriculture, the following work was carried out: draft veterinary certificates for the import of chilled lamb and live sheep to Iran were coordinated, work on frozen mutton is being conducted, veterinary certificates for the importation of large and small cattle, chicken eggs to the UAE were signed. 
      In addition, work is carried out with the veterinary services of Israel and Saudi Arabia to open exports of Kazakh products of animal origin. 
      The Chinese market is already open for Kazakhstani fish and fish products, brood animals of horses family, as well as honey and bee products. In June, it is planned to sign the Protocol on frozen mutton, the conditions for the import of commodity horses into this country are coordinated. 

      Also one of the objectives of the State program is to improve the efficiency of water resources use in providing regular and inundated method irrigation lands with irrigation water, improve reclamation conditions and restore the irrigation infrastructure, and improve the efficiency of water consumption in industry. 

      To restore the irrigated lands, agreements were signed with the Islamic Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to the amount of 103.4 billion tenge for the restoration and involvement of 205 thousand hectares of land. 

      During the meeting, the Minister answered all questions of interest to the population. Such an open dialogue format was perceived positively, as they were able to express their problems, proposals directly to the head of the department. 
      As it was noted, last year during the meeting of the Minister of Agriculture, the population received more than 1200 questions. This year, with the adoption of the State Program, many systemic issues and problems have found their solution.

      Deputy of the Prime Minister - Minister of Agriculture of Kazakhstan Askar Myrzakhmetov considered problematic issues and the state of agriculture in East Kazakhstan region in a selector mode.

      The minister discussed issues on the payment of bonuses from budget to transhumance employees depending on length of service, grants for training their children in secondary and higher education and housing.
      "Taking into account that the transhumance, particularly sheep breeding, is conducted under the conditions of remoteness from populated areas, in the absence of the necessary social and living conditions, it is extremely acute problem of recruitment and staffing of personnel in this sector. The Ministry of Agriculture supports all initiatives and proposals in this direction and cooperates with the Health and Social Development Ministry to implement them," A.Myrzakhmetov said.
      Issue on added tax of agricultural products in the region was discussed. According to representatives of the region it is necessary to reduce the standard VAT (12%) within 50% or to increase the VAT rate not higher than 6% to preserve production level and food product implementation.
      However, it was noted that MNE considers the tax issues on the development of the Tax and Customs Code in the framework of meetings of the working group. Despite this, the Ministry will sent the relevant questions to all the competent authorities.
      The participants of the meeting discussed the issues of improving the utilization of budgetary funds for transfer program. In particular, a number of proposals were adopted, and the Minister gave appropriate instructions to the heads of structural divisions to consider the above issues and find effective solutions.

      Deputy Prime Minister of Kazakhstan - Minister of Agriculture of Kazakhstan Askar Myrzakhmetov held a teleconference meeting on the current situation in agriculture in Zhambyl region.

      During the meeting representatives of Zhambyl region touched upon issues of lack and efficiency of livestock industry subsidies. Thus, this year Zhambyl region on the subsidy programs of the livestock industry will require additional 2.1 billion tenge, and investment subsidies - 2.8 billion tenge.
      The Ministry of Agriculture in connection with the economic growth and increase of employment in 2016 together with the regional akimat made an inquiry for additional 30.2 billion tenge. 5.7 billion tenge of which will be allocated for Zhambyl region. Furthermore, this inquiry is supported by the Ministries of Finance and National Economy.
      Further they raised questions of timely delivery of ear tags for cattle. According to representatives of the region, in 2015-2016 delivery of ear tags were carried out untimely.
      A.Myrzakhmetov instructed the relevant industry departments to prevent slow delivery, create a sufficient number of national reserve, to make deliveries on time before March 1 of the reporting year, and introduce delivery terms to the corresponding rule.
      The farmers of Zhambyl region were interested as well in requirements for delivery of lease equipment. If to consider all views of representatives of the region, due to the specificity of each region, it is impossible to apply single requirements for leasing for all regions of Kazakhstan. For example, in the southern regions the amount of farmland is much less than in the northern regions of the country. And one of the requirements of the farmers is to obtain a certain amount of land. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the geographical characteristics of each region.
      In conclusion, the Minister of Agriculture ordered to review the lease requirements in accordance with the specificity of each region of the country.

This was announced by Deputy Prime Minister of Kazakhstan - Minister of Agriculture of Kazakhstan Askar Myrzakhmetov at the board meeting on issues related to fake veterinary certificates for meat products.

      According to the Ministry of Agriculture, sanitary requirements should be tightened at the markets of Astana and other cities, as fake veterinary certificates for meat products were given there. At the moment official investigations against those who allowed the release of fake certificates were initiated, and letters to the relevant law enforcement agencies were sent.
      A.Myrzakhmetov noted that such animal health workers should not work, and if guilt is proved - immediately they should be fired from their jobs.
      "You speak about official investigation that is conducted. This is tantamount to a crime. Law enforcement authorities will hold an investigation at their level. At the same time, we must not allow such actions at our own level. It is necessary to register in the employment contract the responsibility for such actions. It is scandalous facts, which have no place in veterinary medicine. I instruct to investigate and report on taken actions in the near future," A.Myrzakhmetov said.
      During the board meeting, the Deputy Prime Minister urged not to discuss all the known facts, but acute problems of the industry. It is the only way to achieve results in the activities.

      In the Address “Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Incomes and Quality of Life,” the Head of State paid special attention to the agro-industrial complex. In particular, it was instructed to fully implement the potential of the agro-industrial complex. How the President’s instructions are being implemented and how the year passed for the agrarian sector, read in the review material of РrimeМinister.kz.

      According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the year 2018 was generally favorable for increasing yields and crop production.
      Regional departments of agriculture report that the yield of grain crops in the initial weight was 15.1 centners per hectare, which is 0.6 centners per hectare or 3.9% higher than the level of 2017. About 9.5 centners of oilseeds were harvested from 1 hectare, of potato — 197.8 c / ha, of vegetables — 256.7 c / ha, melons and gourds — 236 c / ha, cotton — 26.4 c / ha, sugar beet — 304.4 c / ha.
      The increase in yield contributed to an increase in crop production. Thus, the gross grain harvest in the initial weight amounted to 22.8 million tons of grain, which exceeds 2017 level by 759.9 thousand tons, or 3.4%. Gross harvest of oilseeds in the initial weight is estimated at 2,686.6 thousand tons, potatoes — 3,896.8 thousand tons, vegetables — 3,937.6 thousand tons, melons and gourds — 2,242.2 thousand tons. Also 350 thousand tons of raw cotton and 595.7 thousand tons of sugar beet were collected.
      According to the Ministry of Agriculture, in 2018 in the republic, the sown area of ​​crops amounted to 22 million hectares, which is 170 thousand hectares or 0.6% more than in 2017.
      Due to the systematic measures taken in the livestock industry, the share of cattle in organized farms increases annually and today amounts to 44.2% of the total livestock. For comparison, in 2011 this figure was 23.3%.
      The volume of milk production only in organized farms for 11 months amounted to 1.4 million tons. For comparison, in 2015 they produced 900 thousand tons. Similar dynamics was observed in the production of meat in organized farms: 409.2 thousand were produced for 11 months, which is 6.9% more than in 2017.
      In January-September 2018, exports of agricultural products totaled more than $2 billion. Including exports of processed products totaled $780 million. For 11 months 2018, 17.5 thousand tons of beef were exported, with a plan of 15 thousand tons.
      In general, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, an increase in the volume of attracted investments in the fixed capital of agriculture is observed in the republic: over 10 months it was 18.4%, and in food production — 33.7%.
       
      Planned measures for the implementation of the Head of State's Address can be divided into three groups: system, industry and specific investment projects.
      As part of systemic measures, mechanisms are being improved and the volume of state support is increasing. Previously, the entire state support amounted to 240 billion tenge plus 60 billion tenge of a budget loan, which at the year-end returns to the budget, these are, in fact, repayable funds. On the instructions of the Head of State, an additional 100 billion tenge will be allocated for the State Program annually as well as 200 billion tenge to solve the problem of affordable lending to priority projects of the agro-industrial complex. Thus, the volume of state support will be increased two times.
      These funds will be directed to the implementation of the following tasks: stimulating the introduction of modern technologies in the industry, updating agricultural equipment, increasing the availability of financing agribusiness entities, including by increasing the volume of investment subsidies, and cheapening and expanding the availability of bank loans both for working capital and investment targets.
      In addition to increasing the volume, it is planned to change the direction of subsidies. In particular, inefficient subsidies will be reduced. Therefore, the main approaches to their change have been developed.
      According to the results of the reform, out of 54 types of subsidies, 34 subsidies will remain.
      At the same time, it should be understood that it is impossible to rely only on subsidies. The industry is large, it is impossible to cover all with state support measures. Therefore, it is necessary to attract other financial institutions, use the existing banking infrastructure.
      For this, the Ministry of Agriculture in 2018 resumed subsidizing interest rates on loans for fixed assets, as well as leasing of agricultural equipment and agricultural animals. Due to this, for 10 months 2018, 2,752 units of equipment for about 50 billion tenge were leased. For comparison, for the entire 2017, equipment was leased out by 40.2 billion tenge, or 19.8% less. In general, in 2018 about 60 billion tenge was directed to leasing programs.
      In addition, the approaches to investment subsidies have been changed. This gave impetus to the initiation of new investment projects. If in 2017 only Kazagro approved 40 large investment projects for 45.1 billion tenge (the average project cost was 1.13 billion tenge), then from the early 2018 — 76 projects worth 104.5 billion tenge (average project cost 1,38 billion tenge).
      In the future, in these areas, the volume of state support will only increase.
      Now the Ministry of Agriculture has begun to expand and engage other financial institutions in financing the agricultural sector. Planned reorientation of second-tier banks from lending to other sectors to lending to the agro-industrial complex.
      To this end, a package of changes in legislation has been formed, providing for the improvement of existing and introduction of new financial instruments, such as an agrarian receipt.
      Measures are being taken to protect the domestic market and expand foreign markets. To this end, systematic work is underway to harmonize veterinary and phytosanitary requirements, harmonize legislation in the field of technical regulation, integrate into the WTO, the EAEU, and enter the markets of neighboring countries.
      On behalf of the Head of State, the reform of agrarian science and education has begun, setting them up for business needs and technology transfer. The work is conducted in three directions — education, science and the system of dissemination of knowledge.
      As part of industry measures, long-term industry programs have been developed for the main areas of the agro-industrial complex. These are programs for the development of meat and dairy cattle breeding, poultry farming, and irrigated land.
      For example, the meat program is based on small and medium-sized farms. For its implementation, a special preferential credit product “Sybaga” has been launched. In 2018 the plan has already been exceeded, despite the fact that its implementation began only in the second half of the year. To date, about 600 farmers have received loans.
      According to the poultry program, it is necessary to increase the level of poultry meat production by three times (from 200 thousand tons to 700 thousand tons) and thus ensure import substitution. This year the project “Makinsk Poultry Farm” has been launched with an annual capacity of 60 thousand tons. This is the largest project at this stage in the poultry industry. Similar work is being done on other programs. For regions, measures and indications of sectoral programs are cascaded into regional programs.
      In addition to the implementation of systemic and sectoral measures, the Ministry of Agriculture planned and has already begun to implement large investment projects.
      The ministry intends to attract multinational companies with its export markets, which invest not only capital, but also new production and processing technologies, introduce new approaches to management, and the ability to export Kazakhstani agricultural products under the sign of recognized global brands.
      For example, there is a cooperation with the Italian company Cremonini Group on the construction of an ultra-modern meat processing plant, with the Chinese corporation CITIC Construction on the creation of a joint investment fund and irrigation, with the Chinese company Golden Camel on the processing of camel milk, with the British Dunbia on cooperation in the livestock industry, with the American AGKO for the construction of a pig farm and the development of aquaculture, with the German CLASS for the production of agricultural machinery, with Korean Hyundai Corporation for the production of tractors in Kazakhstan.
      In order to introduce the best practices of the development of agrarian science and expand international cooperation, work is underway to form a pool of modern scientists by sending at least 300 domestic scientists for internships and training to leading foreign scientific centers for a PhD degree, conducting joint research.
      In addition, it is planned to introduce a benchmarking system for all agricultural research institutes —  the orientation of each to global research organizations, as well as the introduction of English as a working language; requirements for scholars on publications in international scientific journals.
      Taking into account international experience in order to impart practical character to domestic agricultural science, regional research-and-production research centers are created in the form of agropolygones, agroparks and agrocenters on the basis of subsidiaries of the National Agrarian Science and Education Center.
      On the basis of the centers being created, work will be organized on introducing the best international experience in Kazakh science and production, including by attracting reputable foreign experts, conducting research on the most efficient technologies in the context of regions and agro-climatic zones, demonstrating the results, and organizing the transfer of knowledge to agricultural producers.
      In the framework of this work, some organizationshave been created:
       
      In order to implement the best research experience in the framework of the International Science Center being established, it is planned to attract gray heads — reputable foreign scientists. The consortium created by the NASEC NJSC with the National Center for Biotechnology and the Scientific and Production of the Grain Economy named after A.I. Barayev began the search and attraction of leading scientists, the introduction of modern standards into the existing research institute system.
      Thus, in 2018 research organizations of the NANOC group attracted 31 foreign scientists, including 7 from the PRC, 1 from the USA, 1 from Moldova, 1 from Holland, 3 from Germany, 2 from Turkey, 9 from Russia , 2 from Japan, 2 from South Korea, 1 from Belarus, 1 from Sweden, 1 from Iran.
      In order to solve existing problems in the labor market and take additional measures to raise the standard of living of the population, the task is to stimulate mass entrepreneurship and provide employment.
      In this regard, it is planned to continue the entrepreneurship project "Bastau Business."
      The Bastau Business project is aimed at teaching entrepreneurial skills, including the principles of forming agricultural cooperatives, as well as supporting their business projects.
      In addition, the implementation of the system’s activities of sharing knowledge for 2019 additionally provides for 592,685 thousand tenge. In this connection, at present, the Ministry of Agriculture is developing a concept for building a system of mass training for agribusiness entities. The approach to the provision of extension services for the subjects of the agro-industrial complex will be radically revised in order to increase the coverage of agricultural producers with new knowledge in the field of agriculture.
       
      In February 2017, a new State Program for the Development of the AIC for 2017–2021 was approved. This was one of the most important events in the field of agriculture of the country. The program should become a significant incentive for domestic agricultural producers, give a new round to the development of agriculture as a whole and significantly increase export performance.
      The first results are already available: the diversification of acreage has begun, the state program of the agro-industrial complex has increased food production, the level of processing and export of domestic agricultural products, created the necessary conditions for the emergence of agricultural cooperatives and the further development of agriculture in general.
      In general, the Plan of measures of the State Program provides for the implementation of 20 measures for 2018, the achievement of 8 indicators and 41 performance indicators.
      Actual values ​​for the achievement of indicators and indicators will be known in March 2019.
      The main goal of the state program is to increase productivity in agriculture by 2.5 times. This indicator is decomposed into all regions. For the first half of this year, this figure increased by 9% over the same period last year.
      For the first time in pilot mode, the implementation of the state program is managed using the project approach. For this purpose, a full-fledged project office has been created, which conducts operational control and spot monitoring of projects throughout their entire life cycle.
      The entire state program in accordance with the standards of project management was decomposed into 10 sectoral investment programs for the development of the agro-industrial sector (meat, dairy farming, poultry farming, pig breeding, irrigated land diversification, sugar industry, gardening, etc.), 14 regional programs, as well as interaction with other government agencies for the development of 10 related subprogrammes for the development of the agro-industrial complex and rural areas (including “Aul — El Besigi”).
      For each sectoral and regional program, there are clear indications for a 10-year period, as well as priorities and measures, and measures of state support with appropriate amounts and sources of funding are identified.
      Thus, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, all the tasks of the Head of State, set in the Address "Growing of Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Incomes and Quality of Life" and "Third Modernization of Kazakhstan: Global Competitiveness" are reflected in the State Program of AIC Development and are being actively implemented by the Government of Kazakhstan and specialized departments. As a result, we have tangible results in the development of the agro-industrial sector in 2018.

      Until the end of 2016 more than 190 agricultural cooperatives will be organized in Kazakhstan, in this connection over 67 thousand new permanent jobs will be created.

      According to the director of animal production and processing department of the Ministry of Agriculture Erkebulan Akhmetov, in accordance with the instructions of the Head of State  the ministry has developed a separate plan of action to employ the rural population.
      "We plan to use funding sources of the ERM- 2020. Overall, the proposed measures of the MA include the establishment of milk collection points, feedlots, which will be united in agricultural cooperatives,” Akhmetov said during a briefing devoted to the implementation of measures to employ the rural population at the Ministry of Agriculture.
      According to him, private farms in Kazakhstan produce more than 70-80% of milk and meat, while the workload of processing enterprises is only 60%. This is due to the lack of infrastructure for harvesting and transporting agricultural products of private farms. The established agricultural cooperatives can further engage also in other areas, such as harvesting of wool and skins, fruits, bee-keeping, poultry farming family and commodity fish farming.
      The implementation of the proposed measures will create more than 67 thousand new permanent jobs.
      "The republic has more than 1.5 million self-employed, and in the framework of the proposed measures it is planned to involve more than 190 thousand farms due to microcredit. They will get funds financed to create milk collection points and feedlots, and thus through the cooperatives will be interrelated with processing enterprises,” he said.

      At the briefing in the press center of the Government, Chairman of the Committee on Water Resources of the Ministry of Agriculture Islam Abishev explained the objectives of the Irrigated Lands Development Plan until 2028, approved Dec. 25 at the meeting.

      The main goal of the program is to provide land with irrigation water on an area of ​​3.5 million hectares. At present, the area of ​​irrigated land is 1.4 million hectares. At the same time, 600 thousand hectares of irrigated lands that are out of circulation will be restored, and 1.5 million hectares of new ones will be introduced.
      “What do we get from this? We plan that labor productivity per person will increase from 2.3 million tenge to 5.9 million tenge, and about 300 thousand new jobs will be created. At the same time, the growth of gross revenues of irrigated lands by 2028 will amount to 3,727 billion tenge,” said Abishev.
      If today irrigated land makes up 7% of the total cultivated area and 40% of the gross agricultural product is produced on these irrigated lands, while increasing the area of ​​irrigated land to 3.5 million hectares, the share of irrigated land in the total cultivated area will reach 15%, and 80% of the gross agricultural product will give irrigated land. In addition, it is planned that 70% of products will be exported abroad.
      Abishev also spoke in more detail about the mechanism for providing land with irrigation water.
      “Over the past five years, an average of about seven billion tenge a year was spent on restoring the water infrastructure. To provide irrigated land with water on an area of ​​3.5 million hectares, 1.2 trillion tenge is necessary. If this amount is divided by seven, then we will need over 100 years to reach the goal. But the time does not wait. To achieve this global goal, it is necessary to apply the principle of public-private partnership. This is the essence of the new program,” the committee chairman noted.
      In addition, it was indicated that the practice of using the mechanism of public-private partnership is widely used throughout the world: supported by international financial centers, the business community and the agricultural sector.

      The need to change the rules of stabilization funds operation was considered at the next session of the Government. Ministry of Agriculture proposes to withdraw from the implementation of a clear mechanism of stabilization funds and to establish the possibility of using various mechanisms  of food price stabilization.

      "In this regard, we propose three mechanisms for stabilization of prices for food products," First Deputy Minister of Agriculture Kairat Aituganov said.
      Firstly, this is a simplification of the existing order of business stabilization funds. Today, the process of decision-making for purchase or sale of Stabilization Fund resources heavily regulated. It is proposed to remain the approval procedure with the Commission the list of goods and maximum allowance.
      In the second mechanism proposed to allow the SEC to create a company on the basis of public-private partnership with a share of state participation in the authorized capital of not more than 49%. For private companies, this project will benefit from the resources provided by the SEC - trade credit or cash, stores and other social SEC objects. The advantage for the SEC is to minimize the need for additional infrastructure costs.
      The third mechanism develops requirements for commercial facilities. Contract is concluded with the trading objects; mayor’s offices rpovide - lending facility from the commercial facility - a commitment to the implementation of a specific range of products at a fixed price set by the agreement.
      For the implementation of these mechanisms, changes will be made in the law of the agribusiness in the exclusion concept of "stabilization fund" and the inclusion of the concept of "foodstuffs mechanisms to stabilize prices."

      Measures to prevent the growth of prices for socially important food products considered at the next session of the Government.

      "In general, we can say that the regions carried out some work, and it is strengthened in some species. In particular, the number of fairs is increased. Thus, for the period from September to November 1493 fairs were conducted; products worth 9.1 billion tenge were sold there. Whereas for the entire 2015, their number was 3 500. Nevertheless,stabilization funds are ineffective," said in his speech, First Vice-Minister of Agriculture Kairat Aituganov.
      According to the speaker, the situation analysis has identified a number of problems. Thus, the funds, allocated to the stabilization, are on deposit. It is seen from the slide. In some regions, the size of the deposit more than half of the allocated funds.
      In addition, attention is drawn to the huge receivables, which in some cases reached 90%.
      According to K. Aituganov, these problems are due primarily inefficient management.
      For example, Almaty mayor's office allocated 14 billion tenge to the stabilization funds in December last year. 13.4 billion tenge of this amount are on deposit to the present day . At the same time, food prices in Almaty have increased by 8.4% since the beginning of the year.
      "We need to draw up clear plans of work of stabilization funds, which must be determined by that purchase, when, who, where to store, implemented in a period. However, sufficient attention to the mechanism is not paid in the regions and such plans do not constitute. As a result, stabilization funds operate on a case by case," emphasized First Vice-Minister.

The Veterinary Control Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Kazakhstan will continue to work with the Chinese side to remove the restriction from the five remaining regions on the basis of the newly received status.
      The countries of the Persian Gulf, Iran and Israel also because of the received status are ready to coordinate with Kazakhstan the permission to export of livestock products from the entire territory of the republic.
      "The decision of the OIE was the result of systemic changes in the country's veterinary service under the new State Program for the Development of the Agroindustrial Complex of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2017-2021 and opens new opportunities for domestic agricultural producers", – said the First Deputy of the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
      For reference:
      Foot and mouth disease is a listed disease of the OIE, which is characterized by high contagiousness, the presence of several types, subtypes of the pathogen, has a wide range of susceptible animal species, versatility of transmission paths. In this regard, at the international level the existence of a status of a safe area from foot and mouth disease is an obligatory condition for export and import.

      One of the first issues to consider was poaching in the Caspian Sea; it negatively affects the activities of two sturgeon fish-breeding plants. Accordingly, the representatives of the region were asked to increase the capacity of plants production from 7 to 12 mn tons; it requires additional funds from the state budget to purchase related equipment.
      The second issue was concerned the renovation of material and technical base of Atyrau regional territorial inspection for forestry and wildlife to increase efficiency in the fight against poaching.
      The minister noted that considering the economic state the national budget does not provide funds for the above-mentioned problems. Atyrau mayors office may consider these issues at the local level without attracting additional funds from outside.

Previously, the threshold power in issuing investment grants was five thousand tons, but now the requirement is reduced to two thousand tons," said. A.Myrzakhmetov.
      Next similar to this topic relates to provisions on the establishment of cattle feeding areas and its extensions. It required to increase well-fed stock by more than three thousand. This created an obstacle to many average-level businesses. Accordingly, these sites could not expand its activities as an average fattening produced 500 heads of cattle.
      The working group, established under the Ministry, considers this provision.
      The other two issues were related to quail and goat farms financing.

Credit programs for the creation of milk collection centers, as well as funding conditions for the establishment and development of agricultural co-operatives are created. All this will increase the level of food independence of the country," K. Aituganov added.
      "By increasing the production volume, we are faced with the problem of distribution, in particular the unavailability of trading places to producers, intermediaries and numerous uncontrolled margins.

Dealers receive excess profits from trading activities," First Vice-minister said.
      There are two tools for price regulation: a mechanism for the establishment of thresholds and maximum prices and the formation of the stabilization fund. First, according to Aituganov is ineffective, does not work in practice.
      "I consider it necessary to the Ministry of National Economy to revise it. With regard to the second mechanism, unfortunately, regions use its potential inefficiently. Illustrative statistics on goods purchase volume of the stabilization fund over the past year in the period from August 2015 to August 2016. The main share of purchased volumes is in Kyzylorda, East Kazakhstan region, Zhambyl and Kostanay regions. The work with the Stabilization Fund is being inactive. Akmola, West Kazakhstan, Astana have a share of 1% of the total purchase. In our opinion, today there are all conditions to organize an effective system of product distribution to the end consumer, " the speaker said.

This was reported by Director of the Department of manufacturing, processing and crop production of the Ministry of Agriculture Azhar Kadzhybekova during a press conference in the CCS.

      New productive employment development program and mass business, which started on January 1 this year, provides a number of mechanisms for free education of youth and the creation of employment opportunities for them, reported Minister of Health and Social Development of Kazakhstan Tamara Duissenova during a meeting of the Government of Kazakhstan.

      The main focus of the updated program is to develop specific skills based on mass training. These skills will enhance job opportunities or to start their own business. This will contribute to employment centers and mass business development measures, where micro-credit instruments, using them not only in rural areas, as previously, but also in cities, are extended.
      Three key areas identified for the implementation of this task.
      Firstly, particular attention will be paid to young people not enrolled in secondary special or higher education and no education. And it is about 100 thousand people. They will have the opportunity to receive the first working profession free of charge on the basis of technical and vocational education institutions.
      Second, measures to ensure the employment of young people will include the organization of career guidance. In 2017, vocational guidance offices in all secondary schools as well as universities and colleges will be launched with the MES .
      Thirdly, one of the barriers during the employment of young people who have graduated from educational institutions, is the problem of so-called "first job", associated with a lack of work experience. To solve it, the component "Youth Practice" will be saved, which allows the graduates due to state support to acquire skills and initial work experience, which subsequently improves their opportunities for permanent employment.
      It is worth noting that on the results of 2016, the youth unemployment rate decreased more than four-fold - from 16 to 3.9% in comparison with 2001.

      It is necessary to develop a single housing program Nutly zher to reduce population's need for housing, said the Head of State at an enlarged Government meeting.

      "I would especially like to pay attention to housing issue; we need to give this issue a special impetus. We pay a lot of attention for the development of this sector. Nine mn square meters of housing introduced in the country last year; it is a record number for Kazakhstan at all times. Following the results of last year, the volume of housing construction will exceed 10 mn square meters. The relevant state programs are implemented to solve the problems and provide the population with affordable housing since 2005. At the same time, the population's need for housing is quite high, " said  N. Nazarbayev.
      In this regard, the President instructed the Government of Kazakhstan to develop a single housing program Nurly zher and integrate into it all housing issues from the existing programs.
      "The new program should take into account the following. First, is to move the emphasis from direct financing of housing to encourage private developers. It is necessary to stimulate effective demand among the population and to develop measures to reduce the cost and promote mortgage lending by commercial banks, including interest rate subsidies. Another component of the program should be the progress of construction of credit housing through housing savings system. At the same time, the construction of housing credit should be transferred into extra-budgetary funding and budget should support only in the form of subsidies to reduce the cost of loans," said N. Nazarbayev.
      The President also noted that the solution of the problem of individual housing construction is directly related to the capabilities of the state to provide allocated land of engineering infrastructure.
      "Therefore, the Government needs to consider the mechanism for repayment of the funds from the citizens, who will build a house, invested to create such infrastructure,"  said N. Nazarbayev.

      11 projects were implemented within the framework of grant funding in 2016. Basically, projects affected topics of gender equality in Kazakhstan, the issue of children and young people, protection of their rights. Also,grant projects focused on the development of mediation, a national dialogue (Civil Society Forum), expert communities (Congress of political scientists), coordination of public councils, strengthening the Kazakh identity.
      VII Civil Forum of Kazakhstan was one of the major projects as part of the grant funding in 2016, which was attended by more than 300 NGOs, where the most topical issues of interaction between state bodies and non-governmental sector have been raised.

The reference and consulting service and crisis call-center for children is planned to be created on its basis.
      "Creation of this service proves its efficiency. It is planned to maintain this subject in the framework of the grant funding. It can be a variety of social employment service, consulting, educational centers, research in the areas of civil society, education, employment, right," said A.Galimova.
      In general, theme of grants is approved in accordance with the priorities of the state, taking into account the suggestions of experts and NGOs. In the framework of the competition for grant funding, NGO independently offers solutions for the implementation of the proposed topics. At the end of the contest, an independent expert committee takes a decision on the allocation of grants for the implementation of the most efficient and effective project.
      Also, according to the expert, the award will be given on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan to non-governmental organizations, which implemented successful social projects based on public suggestions and evaluation of their activities, since 2017.
      The operator in the field of grant funding - NGO "CISC", which has a role in the accumulation fund to work with NGOs, has been created as part of the legislative innovations.
      "It should be stressed that the operator does not monopolize the sphere of public funding of NGOs as well as the mechanism of state social, as before, will be in action," said chairman of the committee.
      As for the base of these NGOs, in accordance with the Law of Kazakhstan "On state social order, and awards grants for NGOs in the Republic of Kazakhstan," all NGOs send information about its activities to the authorized body for its formation.

This applies, for example, the introduction of grant financing system. Certain questions were worked on special interactive areas for NGOs. For example, Coordinating Council for Cooperation with NGOs works under the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Civil Society, an advisory body on human rights issues works under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

It includes 13 recommendations and 53 measures for their implementation.

      Modernization of the pension system aims to create a multi-level system. At the same time, it should be diversified by sources, said Minister of Labor and Social Protection Tamara Duissenova during a press conference in the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

      Minister recalled that the state pays a solidarity pension since 1998, basic since 2005. All the employed citizens transfer 10% of their wages to the accumulative pension fund since 1998. All this remains unchanged. New - henceforth the employer will be included in the pension system. He will contribute 5% of the wages of his employee.
      The transition to a system with three funding sources is planned to be implemented in 2020. World practice shows that a multi-level pension system is more stable and allows to receive adequate amounts of pensions.
      Also, T.Duissenko reminded that it is planned to further increase pensions paid from the state budget in the next years. From July 1, 2017, both solidarity and basic pensions will be increased by 20% compared to 2016. Basic pensions, disability benefits, and loss of bread-winner will be increased by 16% from January 1, 2018. From July 1, 2018, the methodology of the basic pension will be changed: now the basic pension will be paid depending on the length of participation of citizens in the pension system. This will affect more than 3 million people.
      "This provides for additional expenditures from the state budget. About 300 billion tenge is already provided for in the budget. We expect that the average pension will be increased by 45% from July 1, 2018 compared to 2016, " Minister commented.
      The ideology of targeted social assistance will be completely changed: targeting is strengthened, TSA is paid instead of three benefits, which is much higher, and the poverty line will be increased from 40 to 50% of the subsistence level. This measure will also increase the size of TSA. About 7,000 families participated in this program and 90% of 8,000 able-bodied members of these families were employed last year.
      Transformations in the system of special social services began in 2009. We can say that the market of special social services is completely demonopolized for today.
      "If earlier services were provided only by state boarding schools, more than 100 NGOs provide special social services to 6,000 citizens for today. If we did not demonopolize the market, we would have to build 60 boarding houses, isolating these people from our family, "explained T. Duissenova.
      In conclusion, Minister noted that the department plans to create small-size houses on the ground. The positive experience is already there - "Balapan" program. Houses of small capacity can be created within the framework of PPP. Further, it is planned to disaggregate boarding houses, where there live from 100 to 600 people for today. The main goal of all these transformations is the provision of social services where the person lives.

      In the framework of economic modernization, an urgent task of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population is to upgrade the skills of labor resources. Minister of Education of Tamara Duissenova told about the work carried out by the Ministry on execution of instructions of the Head of State, announced in the Adress "The Third Modernization of Kazakhstan: Global Competitiveness" at a press conference in the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

      She noted that the department launched modernization in four areas: the modernization of labor market, modernization of pension system, modernization of the system of social assistance to citizens and modernization of the system of special social services.
      Modernization of labor market is directly related to the modernization of the economy. According to the forecast of the Minister, the forthcoming fourth industrial revolution will lead to the fact that many professions will "get rid" of themselves and will be excluded. Individual industries will disappear. This is due to the fact that new industries and new professions are emerging. This process will lead to the release of labor resources, on the one hand, and to an increase in the demand for highly skilled workers, on the other hand.
      T. Duissencova noted that, the Ministry faces the urgent task of improving the skills of labor resources in the framework of economic modernization. There is a significant problem on labor market today.
      "The number of employees exceeds 6 million people. 20% of them have a secondary education. If we look at our reserves, which we could involve in the economy, 32% out of 445,000 are unemployed people who have only a school education. About 50% out of 2.3 million self-employed people have only secondary education," Minister said.
      In this regard, the Program for Productive Employment and Mass Entrepreneurship was launched on January 1 of this year. The main goal of the Program is the mass training of citizens in demanded professions in labor market or the basics of entrepreneurship. Everyone who receives an education must have such professional skills that would allow him to find a job, open his own business or expand his business. The program has three directions. Within the framework of the first one - "Education of citizens" - persons from 15 to 24 years old will be able to study free of charge for the first profession within the framework of technical and vocational education. This will primarily involve 21,000 young people who can not pass UNT for several years. The state will allocate scholarships for this category of people and provide free travel and one-time hot meals.
      Short-term courses will be organized for people over 24 years of age. They can get second profession for free here.
      Mobile training courses will be organized for residents of remote settlements. It will be buses with specially equipped classes. The project in the pilot mode is planned to be launched on May 1 of this year in 5 regions: Akmola, Aktyubinsk, East Kazakhstan, Pavlodar and Kostanay. Most technical specialties will be covered.
      Another innovation - if earlier training was conducted at the request of employers, today the professions with the involvement of directly practicing persons are in demand: businessmen, masters from production. The proportion of classes will be as follows: 30% - theoretical training, 70% - practical classes.
      T. Duissenova noted that there have also been significant changes in the second direction of the Program - microcrediting . If earlier there were three directions in microcrediting, now all these three directions are united. In addition, if previously only rural people were financed and lent to the Road Map, now the city residents can receive a loan under the Program. The amount of loans increased from 3 million tenge to 18 million tenge. The term remained the same - 5 years. Consumer credits should reach 6% per annum up to the end. Another innovation is the receipt of guarantees. If a person opens his business for the first time, agri-guarantee can guarantee up to 85% of the loan amount. And if a person is already engaged in business, then 50% of the cost of his loan can guarantee an agro-guarantee.   
      In matters of social support for vulnerable segments of the population, youth practices, social jobs, public works will remain for vulnerable segments of the population.
      "We will continue voluntary resettlement or increasing the mobility of our citizens from the surplus regions to regions where there is a demand for labor," the head of the department said.
      This direction of the Program began will be implemented from March 1, 2017. The launch was carried out on social workplaces and youth practice. To date, 18.5 thousand people are involved in the third direction of the Program. It is planned to cover about 200 thousand people during the year.

      On June 1, Kazakhstan marks the International Children's Day. In Astana, as well as throughout the country, a cultural and entertainment program was organized with concerts, free meals and attractions on major urban sites and parks. Correspondent of the Primeminister.kz made an overview of the most striking events.

      This year, for the first time throughout Kazakhstan, there was a solemn parade of children's and youth music orchestras and ensembles.
      At 11:00 in each regional center, the city of republican importance and the capital along the central streets and avenues, there were bands of drummers, brass bands and ensembles, choral and dance groups representing all the educational organizations of the country.
      In Astana, more than four thousand participants walked from the city square on the Street Beybitshilik, on the Abay Street, then along the Republic Avenue to Kenessary Street.
      Before the start of the procession, the Minister of Education and Science Yerlan Sagadiev, the Children's Rights Commissioner in Kazakhstan Zagipa Baliyeva and the Deputy Akim of Astana Yermek Amanshayev wished good luck to the children.
      "Such an event is held for the first time, in all major cities of the country there are the same parades. In total about 75 thousand people take part in it. We hope that such a parade will be an annual event, as well as one of the brightest events of the year" - said Yerlan Sagadiyev.
      Each team tried to surprise with synchronism of movements, originality of costumes and, of course, creative numbers.
      Among the participants of the parade were prizewinners of the Academic Olympics and sport competitions, as well as excellent students.
      Such unusual cars could be found today in the streets of Astana.
      At that time in one of the cinemas of the capital the Minister of Culture and Sport Arystanbek Mukhamediuly and about 50 children from socially vulnerable groups watched the animated film "A Stork's Journey ".
      After watching the film, the children visited the National Museum of the Republic of Kazakhstan, where they were given a special tour of the halls of history and culture of their home country.
      On the same day, the star guests of the Open Air concert, timed to the children's holiday, congratulated the students of the social institutions of Astana.
      Students of the Center for Adaptation of Minors welcomed the guests in holiday suits, gorgeous dresses, shirts and ties. The kids prepared a concert program, which they rehearsed for about two weeks.
      Soloists of the group "Asyl" and singer Kairat Bayekenov who performed his hit "Makhabbat", came to visit the children.
      Then the children released balloons to the sky, into which they had previously enclosed notes with secret wishes. According to Aigul Bolatkhan, the senior educator of the Adaptation Center for Minors, all children have one desire - to return to the family, to be next to their mother.
      "Children are temporarily in our center. These are children who, due to circumstances, found themselves in a difficult life situation, were left without parental care. Our children are special. They are very kind, talented, communicative, independent and most importantly, very active - they like to perform on stage, prepare for such events" - A. Bolatkhan says.
      The holiday became truly magical due to the sweet presentation: the public foundation "Dar" presented the children with 100 pieces of ice cream. In addition, the foundation gave the children a lot of useful gifts - rollers, balls, dishes, water coolers, national costumes, sport clothes.
      "The role here is not so much gifts, as our presence. Our attention and care are important to children. We have been working with this center since 2013. Constantly we try to support them" - says Rustam Ibragimov, coordinator of social projects of the “Dar” Foundation of Astana.
      In the meantime, students of the specialized correctional school met no less stellar guests - Rinat Malcagov, Arthur Tolepov and the “Pizza” group.
      The front man of the “Pizza” band Sergei Prikazchikov wished children to believe in themselves and always strive for their dream.
      "I had communicating problems, it really embarrassed me. But I always believed that I would do what I'm doing now and I could do it. And I wish you to fulfill what you want. You should always know what you want from life, and then you will have it all" - the musician congratulated the children.
       
      Kazakhstan singer Zhanar Dugalova and Russian stars Mот and Natan cheered SOS Children's Village with their visit. The children met them according to all the rules of hospitality - in national costumes and with traditional shashu. Joyful boys and girls, vying each other, shouted the names of their favorite artists, shook hands with them and shared their dreams.
      The Humanitarian Fund "Degdar" presented SOS Children's Village Astana with a sports and playground.
      "It is important for our fund that the younger generation have the opportunity to play outdoors, breathe fresh air, play sports. No matter what profession the guys choose, but sport will help them to become strong, confident people" - said Laura Akhmetova, director of the humanitarian fund "Degdar ".
      The guests - Natan, Zhanar Dugalova and Laura Akhmetova, cut the red ribbon at the entrance to the site.
      After the solemn opening, the kids clung to a new place of entertainment.
      The guest from Moscow also did not stay aside. Mot and the boys arranged competitions on the bar, and then they drove the ball.
      … Unexpectedly, Mot sang Acappella.
      The children for a long time did not want to release their favorite performers: someone wanted to make a selfie, and someone - just hug the star more tightly.
      Such a bright and rich was the day for the capital's children. May our future generation live in peace and love.

      The program also focused on the promotion of housing construction by private developers. It is proposed to introduce the available credit resources for it - the state will subsidize part of the interest rates on loans issued by second-tier banks for the construction of new housing. The national budget envisages 11 billion tenge in 2017, which will allow developers to subsidize bank loans in the amount of 157 billion tenge. According to the Ministry of Economy, it will finance further construction of about 600 thousand sq.meters of housing. Half of them will be given to depositors of Housing construction savings bank (Zhilstroysberbank).

Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev gave a number of specific instructions for further work.

      According to the results of the joint actions carried out by all akimats of regions and cities of republican significance, relevant memorandums have been concluded to date. In general, akimats and traders concluded about 90 memorandums.
      “From November 2018, as part of the implementation of the signed memorandums until the end of the heating season, the cost of Shubarkol coal is reduced by an average of 15-20% and Karazirin coal by 5-10%,” said the Minister Kassymbek, noting that in the regions of the country the selling price of coal for the population is reduced on average from 5% to 21%.
      The market prices of coal are reduced in the following regions:
      Minister of National Economy Timur Suleimenov reported on measures to reduce tariffs for electricity, coal, heat, water, gas, sewerage, telephone, Internet, elevator maintenance, garbage collection.
      With regard to short-term measures, from Dec. 11, 2018, in all regions, work has been organized to establish feedback with the population. According to the results, 102 public receptions were held. Hotline telephones are organized for consumers who do not have the opportunity to attend public reception rooms.
      In the sphere of heat supply, tariffs for heat for the population have been reduced in three regions: in Akmola, North Kazakhstan, and East Kazakhstan. In addition, from Jan. 1, 2019, tariffs for the population are projected to decrease from 2.2% to 15.3%. As a result, the savings of public funds for heat supply services will be about 6 billion tenge.
      In the field of water supply, the water tariff for the population in the Zhambyl region was reduced by 22%. In addition, from Jan. 1, 2019, tariffs are projected to decrease in the remaining 16 regions from 3% to 27%. The tariff for water disposal is reduced in the Zhambyl region by 0.4%. In addition, from Jan. 1, 2019, tariffs are projected to decrease for the population in the remaining 16 regions from 3% to 11%. Saving of water and wastewater will be more than 2 billion tenge.
      Of the 11 regions provided with gas, a decrease in gas prices for the population is projected from 3.3% to 17.5% in 9 regions. As a result, the savings of public funds for gas supply services will be about 5 billion tenge.
      Electricity prices were reduced in the Zhambyl region by 3.6% and in the Kyzylorda region by 4%. The forecasted decline in retail prices in other regions from Jan. 1, 2019 will be reduce from 1.7% to 23%.

      The total savings by consumers for utilities, following a tariff reduction, will be about 28 billion tenge.
      Along with this, according to the information provided by akimats of the regions, it is planned to reduce tariffs for utility services from 2.2% to 20%, for garbage collection – from 2.1% to 24.7% and for elevator services – from 3% to 50%.
      As for medium-term measures, in order to enhance the transparency of tariff formation, as well as to monitor the execution of tariff estimates and investment programs by monopolists, two sets of amendments to the Legislation have been prepared.
      The first package of amendments within the framework of the draft law “On Natural Monopolies” on Dec. 20, 2018, was approved at a plenary session of the Senate of the Parliament and will soon be sent for signature to the Head of State. The second package of amendments aimed at strengthening the mechanism for conducting monopolies' inspections and requiring changes to the Business Code is provided for in the draft law on the development of the business environment and regulation of trading activities, which will be considered at a meeting of the Majilis on December 26 .
      In addition, Suleimenov reported that the change in prices for socially important food products was insignificant compared to the last week. Thus, as of December 21, threshold values ​​were observed in almost all regions for two items of goods – cabbage and sugar. According to the data of the Ministry of National Economy, there are objective reasons for the rise in the price of sugar: its prices are growing under the influence of global trends in the sugar market. At the same time, according to the Minister of National Economy, the reasons for the increase in prices for certain types of goods were the result of poor coordination at the level of local executive bodies and can be resolved at the level of akimats. For example, the reasons are the lack of production or storage facilities.
      Following the consideration of the issue, the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev noted that all Kazakhstanis should feel the result of the execution of the Head of State’s instructions. Akims of the regions together with the Ministry of National Economy have been entrusted until Jan. 1, 2018, to make appropriate decisions to reduce tariffs for services and other utilities administered by akimats.
      It is indicated that from Jan. 1, 2019, all service providers must strictly follow the approved reduced tariffs, and their education should be as transparent and understandable as possible to the public.
      In addition, it was noted that the rise in prices for a number of food products is not justified. In this regard, the Ministry of National Economy needs to take control of the issue of ensuring the stability of food prices, including fruit and vegetable products.

      Feb. 19 at the Government meeting chaired by the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, the progress in the implementation of the Digital Kazakhstan State Program was reviewed. Ministers of Information and Communications Dauren Abayev, Industry and Infrastructure Development Zhenis Kassymbek, Education and Science Yerlan Sagadiyev made reports on the progress of the work.

      Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev stressed that the implementation of the Digital Kazakhstan State Program is under special control of the Head of State. A significant economic effect is expected as part of the program’s implementation, which has the potential to increase the value added as well as reduce costs in the economy.
      Over the past year of the program implementation, a positive trend has been recorded in many areas. The legislative base has been improved, the approaches to production have been optimized, business and state administration have been developed. At the same time, in order to increase the efficiency of the implementation of the Government’s digital agenda, the need for the central and local executive bodies to develop a uniform methodology for monitoring and evaluating the effects of digitalization has been expressed.
      Ministry of Information and Communications is tasked to determine the potential for digitalization in certain sectors of the economy and develop a unified methodology for calculating the efficiency of digitalization projects, taking into account the actual cost reduction. In addition, the ministry needs to speed up the development of a draft law on the use of digital technologies with government agencies and the IT community.
      According to the Ministry of Information and Communications, the Digital Kazakhstan State Program is being implemented in five key areas and includes 17 initiatives and 120 events. In 2018, the entire list of planned activities (20 items) was fully implemented.
      In the first direction “Digitization of Industries” — using the elements of Industry 4.0 at the backbone enterprises of the fuel and energy, and mining and metallurgical complexes, the following results were achieved:
      Projects "Intellectual field" and "Digital mine" were introduced at seven large mineral deposits. In 2019, it is planned to increase the number of objects using these systems to 12.
      In the mining industry, the transition of 102 enterprises to "transparent" production has started. As part of the digitalization of transport and logistics, the project "Intelligent Transport System" is being implemented. A road asset management system is also being implemented, within which 16 mobile road laboratories have been launched.
      As part of the digitalization of the agro-industrial complex, elements of precision farming were introduced in 14 pilot farms in the country. This made it possible to reduce the costs of farmers by an average of 15-20% and increase the yield by 2.5 times. In 2019, it is planned to bring the number of “smart farms” to 500 farms.
      Another major direction of the program is the development of online trade. Thus, at the legislative level, tax concessions are provided to e-commerce entities. They have already taken advantage of 331 new e-commerce entity. One of the world's trends began to develop in Kazakhstan — a contactless payment service using a mobile phone. So, in late November 2018, six large banks of the country were connected to the service in a pilot mode.
      Within the “Transition to a Digital State” direction, digitalization covers all levels of education. Today 64% of all preschool organizations accept applications in electronic form. In 94% of schools students use electronic diaries and academic record books. In general, the digitization of the education system has reduced the gap in the quality of education between rural and urban schools by more than 30%.
      As part of the digitalization of healthcare, 99.2% of the organization of healthcare was transferred to paperless medical documents. About 16.3 million citizens of Kazakhstan have regional electronic health passports. The visits to the doctor and the “live” queues in polyclinics are halved. The time to obtain examination results reduced by 2.5 times. In 2019, it is planned to bring the level of electronic health passports to 100%.
      In the social and labor sphere, the electronic labor exchange is successfully functioning. In 2018, more than 533 thousand applicants were employed through the electronic labor exchange, of which 409 thousand were employed for permanent jobs.
      The work on the transfer of government services to electronic format continues. At present, 506 public services out of 752 have been automated. The terms for providing services have been reduced by 40% from an average of 12 to 7 days. At the same time, paper circulation was reduced by 60 million reference documents. In 2018, the population received 30 million public services in electronic format. Three migration, eight specialized, 16 digital public service centers have been opened, biometric data collection has been launched in Almaty and Astana. For 2019, it is planned to transfer 80% of public services to electronic format, as well as to open an additional one digital and five migration centers.
      In the framework of the state program, special attention is paid to supporting small and medium-sized businesses. In 2018, the ASTANA-1 information system was launched, which allows centralized online monitoring of customs procedures and keeping records of payment of duties. The release of customs declarations has been reduced from several days and hours to 1 minute. As of today, 859 thousand electronic declarations have been registered in the system, of which 85% were issued along the “green corridor” within a minute. The system of "Electronic invoices" and "labeling of goods," which can prevent the "shadow" transactions in the field of trade, has been launched.
      “In general, the digital measures implemented in 2018 already have an economic effect of 218 billion tenge. The number of new jobs created as part of digitalization is more than 43 thousand. But the main result of 2018 can be considered that all work processes are established, the areas of responsibility of state bodies are clearly distributed, and national and private companies have a vision of the work ahead. Therefore, we are convinced that this year the economic effect from the introduction of new technologies will be even more tangible,” Abayev reported.
      Minister of Industry and Infrastructure Development Zhenis Kassymbek, in turn, reported that, under the Digital Kazakhstan Program, priority projects are being implemented in the following sectors: industry, transport, utilities, geology and subsoil use.
      On the digitalization of industry in 2018, an audit was completed at seven model factories and road maps for their digitalization were approved. For each company, about 30 events are recommended. Along with this, work is underway to digitize industrial enterprises of the regions. MIID RK together with akimats signed Road maps on the introduction of digital technologies at medium and large industrial facilities. The active work will be continued on digitization of more than 100 enterprises in 2019.
      On the task “Digitization of Transport and Logistics,” the Intelligent Transport System project is under implementation. The system can solve a number of issues on the management of road transport complex. For example, in the field of transport control, 12 special automated measuring tools have been introduced. Until the end of 2019, it is planned to launch another 11 tools on new paid sites. By 2021, their total number is planned to be increased to 46.
      In order to ensure the compliance of the passenger traffic with the schedule, route and regularity in pilot mode, the Dispatching System of inter-regional and international passenger traffic has been launched. By the end of 2019, over 2,000 buses will be connected via 416 routes.
      To improve the condition of the roads in pilot operation, the Road Asset Management System has been implemented. The system predicts the necessary investments and the technical condition of the roads, depending on the chosen repair strategy.
      One of the important components of the intellectual transportation is the system of charging, as well as collecting and providing information about the traffic situation to road users. To date, the Toll Collection System has been commissioned at three roads: Almaty – Kapchagai, Almaty – Khorgos and Astana – Temirtau with a total length of 471 km. In general, by 2020 it is planned to introduce a payment for 16 sections of roads and the length of toll roads will be about 6.5 thousand km.
      As part of the implementation of the E-SHANYRAQ project, at the end of 2018, the Unified Information System of the utilities industry was launched in pilot mode.
      As a result, electronic technical passports of 5,217 apartment houses and 5,767 different metering devices were connected to the system.
      A unified construction information system E-QURYLYS is being introduced in the construction industry. The system allows the blockchain mode to control all stages and processes of construction, ranging from the "pit" to the completion of the object’s construction.
      Minister of Education and Science Yerlan Sagadiyev said that in accordance with the President’s Address and the Digital Kazakhstan program, a number of measures are being taken to develop digital technologies in education, and a digitalization office has been set up for this.
      A typical curriculum on the subject "Information and Communication Technologies" for grades 1-4 has been approved. Thhis academic year the training begins in the third grade. Beginning with the next academic year, the rest of the classes are gradually transferred.
      In accordance with the 76
      Step of the Plan of the Nation "100 Concrete Steps", the study of the subject "Informatics" in secondary education organizations is carried out in grades 5-9 with one hour per week or 34 hours per year, 10-11 grades have 2 hours per week or 68 hours in year. The content of curricula for the subject “Computer Science” has also been revised; modern programming languages ​​in robotics, 3D modeling and machine learning systems have been introduced at schools.
      In order to strengthen the practical orientation of the educational process of students in the ICT disciplines, in 2018, 12 branches of the departments of higher educational institutions were opened at large enterprises. To date, 10 universities have attracted production personnel for practical and laboratory classes. On the basis of six universities, competence centers have been opened to enhance students' digital skills in the areas of information technology, cybersecurity, information security.
      In the field of information technology, the volume of government orders for popular specialties increased. So, in 2018 more than 10 thousand grants for IT specialties were allocated.
      To implement the paragraph 87 of the State Program, an institute for industrial automation and digitalization on the basis of the Satpayev University is being formed.
      The Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the Expansion of Academic and Managerial Independence of Higher Educational Institutions was adopted. The ministry approved more than 20 experimental educational programs in 2019. Since this school year, these programs have been introduced in eight higher education institutions.
      Work is also underway to create a national open education platform, where various educational courses will be presented, including 3D modeling, information security, programming, IT languages, etc. Along with this, projects are being implemented to create a unified education and science management system.

      At the Government meeting chaired by the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, Minister for Investments and Development Zhenis Kassymbek reported on the implementation of the Head of State’s instructions to reduce costs and ensure the transparency of the tariff formation system, as well as on the work on coal supply and price reduction in the regions.

       
      “According to the data provided by akimats, the work on the formation of coal reserves for household needs and for the population for the period from May 1 to Nov. 23 have been generally performed in the planned mode,” reported Kassymbek.
      According to the general needs plan, in ten regions and cities of Almaty and Shymkent, coal reserves are more than 85%. According to local executive bodies, the price of household coal averages 15,000 tenge, depending on the quality and the distance to the consumer.
      In order to reduce tariffs and prices for municipal coal, the Ministry for Investments and Development and the Association of Mining and Metallurgical Enterprises developed a draft memorandum between local authorities and distributors of municipal coal at railway dead ends. Local executive bodies concluded memorandums with owners of dead ends located in some regions, signing is underway in the rest of the regions. This work, according to the ministry, is scheduled to be completed within two days.
      Kassymbek noted that according to the results of this signing, it is planned to reduce selling prices from dead ends and retail sales points. On average, the decline will occur by 15-20% or 2,500-3,000 tenge.
      On the example of Astana, the minister explained how coal prices will be formed at dead ends. The price on the section does not change — on Shubarkul it is 5000 tenge. The trader reduces the price by 60-70%, the premium from 2,985 tenge is reduced to 885 tenge. The difference is 1900-2100 tenge. The cost of rail transportation from the Shubarkul Mine to Astana is 1,715 tenge. On transportation from the station to the overpass 1,242 tenge are spent (delivery of cars from the station to the border of the impasse, to the trestle for unloading, traveling along the owner's branch, unloading the cars).
      “We believe that there are reserves to reduce, so we would ask the antimonopoly authority to study the situation. The markup of the implementer from the deadlock was 2,000 tenge, they reduce by 25-30% to 1,500–1,700 tenge. After the measures taken, the price of coal in Astana within two weeks should decrease by 18% — from 13,600-14,500 tenge to 11,200 tenge. The difference on average is 2,400 tenge,” said the minister.
      In addition, the Ministry for Investments and Development conducted an analysis of coal pricing in Astana with the supply to the nearby settlements. Analysis of the delivery of coal from the dead ends to the final consumer by road transport (service) shows how the coal price is formed. For example, the delivery of coal by road from Astana to the village of Talapker costs 15,000 tenge. The price of delivery for 1 ton of coal is 2,142 tenge. As a result, the price of coal per ton with delivery to the consumer will be 15,642 tenge. After the adoption of the planned measures, the price will be 13,242 tenge.
      Kassymbek stressed that due to the measures taken, wholesale and retail prices should decrease.
      It is planned that in Akmola region the price of coal will decrease by 16%.
      In the Almaty region, the price cutting will be 18%:
      In the North Kazakhstan region, the price of coal should decrease by 17%:
      In Shymkent, the price cuts will amount to 14% from 14,700 tenge to 12,150 tenge.
      Kassymbek noted that after the signing memorandums, the cost reduction of Shubarkol coal at the republic’s railway dead ends will average 15-20%. Also they are ready to reduce the prices for coal of Maykuben West and Karazhyra LLP. In conclusion, the minister said that akimats need to complete all work on this memorandum within two weeks.
      Following the report hearings, Prime Minister Sagintayev noted that the Government, for its part, had completed all the work to reduce coal prices, now the main work is for akimats. In this regard, regional akims are instructed to take control of the coal delivery to the final consumer, as well as against the background of a 15-20% decline in coal prices at dead ends, to prevent unreasonable price increases.

      At a meeting of the Government Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev gave a number of specific instructions for the fire and flood protection.

      After hearing reports on fire prevention in the residential sector and preparedness for the flood period of 2019, the Prime Minister noted that there are problems in providing fire and flood protection for the regions that need special attention. Thus, regional akims need to focus on issues of financing, the causes of fires, as well as the quality of the audit of the residential sector.
      Until the end of the heating season, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and all regional akims are entrusted with keeping the fire safety issues in the residential sector under control. It is necessary to continue the fire prevention work, pay special attention to homes where large and low-income families live, as well as people with disabilities and pensioners.
      The Minister of Internal Affairs is tasked with developing and implementing a set of organizational and disciplinary measures. For inappropriate prevention and fire safety, weakening control:
      With regard to the flood situation it was instructed to ensure readiness for change. Thus, according to Kazhydromet's forecast, in the basins of some rivers, the volume of moisture reserves exceeds the norm. The process of accumulation of snow continues. At the same time, in the third decade of February air temperature is expected to rise.
      According to the forecast of Kazhydromet as of Feb. 1, 2019, the volume of moisture reserves exceeds the norms in the basins of the Akmola, West Kazakhstan, Karaganda and Kostanay regions:
      The process of snow accumulation continues. According to long-term observations in February, March, April, monthly precipitation may fall.
      The monthly synoptic forecast (justifiability of 20-80%) indicates that in the third decade of February, day and night air temperatures are expected to rise, which can lead to snow melt, the formation of thawed snow, and a rise in water levels.
      In addition to snow cover, an important determining factor for future water flow on lowland rivers is autumn soil moisture, which is 100% above the norm in the Nura and Sherubainur river basins in the Karaganda region; above the norm by 68% in the basins of the Ishim, Selety, Shagalaly, Zhabai and Koluton rivers in the Akmola region, but lower than the norm by 40-50% in the river basins of Kostanay, Aktobe, Atyrau and West Kazakhstan regions.
      Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev gave a number of specific instructions to regional akims.
      First. Provide high-quality implementation of the Roadmap for the Prevention and Elimination of Flood Threats. Coordination of the execution is entrusted to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
      Second. Complete the work on the transfer of ownerless hydraulic structures to communal property.
      Third. Ensure the relocation of people and the transfer of objects from water protection zones and lanes.
      Fourth. Ministry of Internal Affairs together with regional akims should ensure full readiness of forces and facilities for the upcoming flood-hazardous period and timely alert the population when there is a possible threat of flooding. Promptly respond to emergencies.
      Fifth. Akims of Akmola, Almaty, Karaganda, Kostanay, Turkestan regions and the Ministry of Agriculture are entrusted to take all measures for the implementation of measures noted in the Plan for the conservation, accumulation and distribution of flood waters and restoration, arrangement of water supply structures (wells) for watering livestock on distant pastures . It is necessary to ensure the implementation of the plan taking into account their integration into the State Program for the Development of the AIC.
      Ministries of National Economy, Finance together with the Ministry of Agriculture, regional akims should consider issues of financing the development of a feasibility study for the construction of new reservoirs and reconstruction of small reservoirs.

      Feb. 12 at the Government meeting chaired by the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, the issue of fire prevention in the residential sector was considered. Minister of Internal Affairs Kalmukhanbet Kassymov reported that measures are being taken to fight fires by the state fire service and local executive bodies. Nevertheless, there are annually recorded facts of fire in the country.

      “Last year, a two times increase in the number of people killed in fires was noted in Atyrau region, in Almaty, East Kazakhstan and Pavlodar regions —  by 25%, Zhambyl region — by 8%. At the same time, over 60% of fires occur in the residential sector, including 40% — due to careless handling of fire by the population, 20% due to violation of fire safety rules during operation of furnaces and 16% due to electrical equipment,” said Minister Kassymov.
      In preparation for the winter period, fire safety months were held in advance in September and December 2018. Since the beginning of the heating period, there has been a decrease in the number of fires by 2%, of deaths by 27%.
      In addition, the department is implementing a set of preventive measures to prevent fires in the residential sector.
      “To coordinate this work in all regions, as well as in the Committee on Emergency Situations, headquarters were created Feb. 6. The analysis was carried out, the most problematic streets, neighborhoods, and areas of settlements in terms of fire safety were identified. On weekends, taking into account the location of the majority of citizens at home, practically the entire staff of civil protection, including administrations, performs a courtyard bypass for conducting explanatory work on fire safety measures,” said Kassymov.
      Employees of private fire services, organizations engaged in services in the field of fire safety and volunteers are involved in this work.
      “Only over the past weekend, we carried out preventive work in 107 thousand private houses (including 7.6 thousand ‘temporary houses’), over 49 thousand violations were revealed. At the same time, tenants of more than 13 thousand houses refused to inspect the furnace equipment,” the minister said.
      Additionally, with the use of fire fighting equipment, inspections of the access roads in the private sector and fire hydrants are carried out.
      The state of objects of high level of fire risk, which include schools, hospitals, kindergartens, large shopping centers, livelihoods and power structures, is under constant control.
      “The State Fire Control, a staff of 933 inspectors, checked more than 40 thousand objects last year, revealed 139 thousand violations, brought to administrative responsibility 21 thousand officials. More than 2 thousand lawsuits were sent to the courts to suspend the operation of objects that do not comply with fire safety regulations. As a result, out of 1,244 objects of trade, 1,060 large shopping centers or 74% completely eliminated violations. On 138 objects, on claims of the Emergency Situations Department the judicial procedures are being conducted to suspend them,” Kassymov said.
      In addition, to improve the security of objects with a massive stay of people in July 2018, a joint Roadmap was approved by a joint order of the ministries of the Interior, National Economy, Finance, Industry and Infrastructure Development and the National Bank. As part of this document, 89 changes and additions have been made to the state standards of the architectural and construction sphere in terms of toughening fire safety requirements for objects with a massive presence of people.

      Jan. 22 at the Government meeting chaired by the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, the issue of public procurement and procurement of quasi-public sector subjects was considered. The Minister of Finance Alikhan Smailov reported on the implementation of the tasks in this direction.

      According to the Ministry of Finance, the total volume of public procurement and procurement of the quasi-public sector in 2018 amounted to 9.2 trillion tenge. Among them: government procurement for 3.6 trillion tenge, Samruk-Kazyna Fund — about 5 trillion tenge and other national companies — about 600 billion tenge. Thus, the volume of public procurement and procurement of the quasi-state sector in 2018, compared with the figures for 2017, increased by 3.4%.
      In order to improve the scope of public procurement and procurement in the quasi-public sector, Dec. 26, 2018, the Head of State signed the Law “On Amendments and Additions to Certain Legislative Acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Public Procurement and Procurement in the Quasi-Public Sector,” which was enacted Jan. 1, 2019. To enforce the law the Ministry of Finance amended the Rules for Public Procurement.
      According to the Minister of Finance, in accordance with the amendments to the law and new amendments to the rules, the web portal of public procurement has been finalized. Thus, from Jan. 1, 2019, all government purchases are made on the web portal in accordance with new amendments to the public procurement legislation.
      In general, the innovations of the law can be divided into 3 blocks.
       
      “The threshold amount of purchases from one source for work and services is increased from 100 MCI to 500 MCI. This greatly simplifies the purchase of minor works and services. Basically, this rule will affect customers with small budgets (kindergartens, schools, clinics, hospitals, cultural centers, boarding schools, nursing homes),” Smailov said.
      At the same time, according to the law, this provision will be valid until 2021, for the period of formation of skills of workers of rural akimats for public procurement. Also in the procurement method of requesting price offers customers are given the right to specify in the documentation for the brand names of goods. This will allow you to buy better products.
       
      “A new qualification requirement is being established in the form of financial stability of a potential supplier. It will be determined by such parameters as paid taxes, availability of current and fixed assets, wage fund. This information will be extracted automatically from the information systems of the State Revenue Committee. It will also allow increasing tax revenues,” Smailov noted.
      The law is aimed at the widespread use of procurement through a contest using prequalification. To this end, the Ministry of Finance has introduced the competence to determine the procurement method, which will allow procurement in the construction sector to be carried out only through a competitive process with prequalification.
      Such an approach will accelerate and improve the quality of construction, since only qualified and reputable suppliers will participate in the procurement.
      It also introduces the compulsory payment of the application and the execution of the procurement contract by way of a request for price offers. Previously, the request for quotations was made without any financial obligations (this led to the avoidance of the conclusion of the contract due to the insolvency of potential suppliers).
      In order to reduce the facts of unjustified appeal of procurement, the law establishes the following norms:
      1) potential suppliers who have not submitted security for the application are prohibited to view documents of other participants;
      2) complaints of potential suppliers to the requirements of tender documentation that did not participate in its preliminary discussion are not subject to consideration;
      3) complaints from third parties who did not participate in the procurement do not suspend the conclusion of the contract.
       
      In addition, a clear concept of “dumping price” and its avoidance are given. Thus, the following thresholds are set in the Rules for Government Procurement, below which the price reduction is not allowed:
      In the conditions of establishing thresholds below which a price reduction is not allowed, all bidders in order to win the competitions will reduce prices to permissible thresholds. This will lead to equality of price proposals, taking into account the use of conditional discounts. In this regard, the Rules have established that, with equal conditional prices, priority will be given to companies with more work experience and a larger amount of paid taxes. It should be noted that the criterion for choosing a supplier for the amount of taxes paid is introduced for the first time.
      “We believe that such a criterion for choosing a supplier with equal conditional prices is fair and will encourage entrepreneurs to pay taxes in good faith. Also, it will not allow winning the competition to companies that transfer all volumes to the subcontract. Thereby they do not pay taxes, do not develop and do not equip their material and technical base. Previously, if the conditional prices were equal, the potential supplier was declared the winner, whose application was received earlier than the bids of other procurement participants. At the same time, this approach to choosing a supplier was prone to corruption, and there was a risk of collusion between the customer and the potential supplier,” explained Smailov.
       
      “Out of 53 reasons for procurement, 5 cases are excluded from one source. In order to reduce purchases from one source, the obligation of customers to repeat purchases if they are declared invalid is established. This will reduce purchases from one source,” Smailov said. It also establishes a ban on the involvement of subcontractors by Enbek enterprises in the penitentiary system as part of single-source procurement.
      In addition, the law provides rules to support domestic producers in accordance with international practice.
      Thus, by analogy with the Russian Federation, a list of cases is established by law in which the Government has the right to establish exemptions from the national regime. The competence of the Ministry of Finance to establish additional requirements for potential suppliers is consolidated. For example, requirements such as availability of a production base in the area of ​​work, local labor resources, etc. will be established.
      Meanwhile, the law provides for the following norms for the procurement of a quasi-state sector:
      At the same time, the Rules of Samruk-Kazyna will be approved by the decision of the Board of Directors of the Fund in coordination with the Ministry of Finance.
      It should be noted that the aforementioned norms of the law on procurement issues of the quasi-state sector come into effect on Jan. 1, 2020. As Smailov emphasized, this is due to the need to develop by-laws and their technical implementation.
      As part of the centralization of public procurement, for the Unified Procurement Organizers at the republican, regional and district levels, the Ministry of Finance approved the corresponding lists of goods, works and services. The order of the Ministry of Finance to approve the lists is effective from March 1, 2019.
      Chairman of the Atameken National Chamber of Entrepreneurs Ablay Myrzakhmetov also spoke during the meeting. According to him, the law on issues of public procurement and procurement of the quasi-state sector will have a positive impact on the protection of the rights of domestic entrepreneurs and the improvement of their qualifications.
      In turn, Managing Director — Head of the Secretariat of Samruk-Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund Alisher Pirmetov reported on the work carried out to improve the procurement system in 2018. Thus, new measures to support domestic processing industries were developed, purchases inside the Fund were optimized, reduced timing of procurement, improved the process of prequalification, introduced a new electronic platform for procurement.
      Following the consideration of the issue, Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev noted that a lot of work had been done in this direction. Amendments have been made to address key issues in public procurement that may contribute to improving the business climate in the country. In this regard, all state bodies, regional akimats should take measures to comply with the requirements of supporting domestic producers in specifying national standards, and prevent the growth of purchases from a single source. The Ministry of Finance is entrusted with conducting large-scale advocacy work on this Law and adopting the necessary by-laws.

      As part of his working trip to Almaty, the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev visited a number of infrastructure facilities in order to familiarize himself with the development of the tourist potential of the city: the Almaty-2 railway station and the Visit Almaty tourist hub. The presentation of the new Carsharing service also took place here.

      During a visit to the new tourist hub Visit Almaty, which was opened in the Baluan Sholak Palace of Sports in November 2018, the Prime Minister was told that every tourist can get all the necessary information in the consulting center: maps, guides, atlases of mountain routes, brochures of tour operators, announcements of cultural events, etc. In addition, consultants are called upon to assist in solving various problems — from emergency, law-related and health, to logistics, for example, “where to eat and how to get to Kok-tobe.” Over 11 months, more than 25.2 thousand tourists received a consultation at the center.
      Sagintayev examined the tourist information center. The director of the Qazaq Oner artisans center A. Zhanserikova presented a yurt and noted a successful location of the hub at the photo-yurt-photozone. Here projects are being implemented to promote tourism potential, an analysis of the competitiveness of the region and the development of tourism is carried out. On the territory of the center there are seven educational zones, decorated in the national style, there is a co-working platform for tourists.
      Deputy akim of the city Y. Aukenov, in turn, said that thanks to the work being done, the number of tourists in the city 2018 increased by 11% compared to 2017. About 43.6% of tourists visited Almaty, almost half of all foreign tourists coming to Kazakhstan. The number of tourists arriving in Almaty for the II quarter of 2018 is 503 thousand people.
      One of the projects to increase the tourist attractiveness will be the reconstruction of Almaty-2 railway station, scheduled for 2019–2020. During the site visit, Sagintayev was informed that the project envisages the construction of an additional terminal, the second route between Almaty-2 and Almaty-1, underground passages and new passenger platforms for suburban routes. In general, the modernization of the station will increase the effective area of ​​the object twice.
      Here, the Prime Minister was informed about the development of the transport infrastructure of the southern capital, presented a new service system “Carsharing.” The system allows to issue a per-minute car rental through the mobile application. This service is available to anyone with a driver's license. In Almaty, the service was launched in October 2018, today the number of registered users of the service exceeds 10 thousand people. Sagintayev examined a number of new cars available for service users. In total, more than a hundred new cars have been launched, while the number in 2019 will be 500, and by 2021 there will be a fleet of 1.5 thousand cars in the country. According to Anytime company, in March 2019, it is planned to start the service in Astana, at the end of 2019 — in Shymkent.
      According to Almaty Akimat, the renewal of the city’s bus fleet will reach 80% in 2018. At the expense of private investment, a car park and a plant for the production of third generation electric buses were built. Their further launch on the routes of the city will have a positive effect on the ecological situation in Almaty. Also in Almaty, the first bus rapid transit line in Kazakhstan was organized, 110 kilometers of designated lanes for public transport and one-way traffic were introduced on 10 central streets, and a cycle corridor from Orbit to Green Bazaar was formed. Two metro stations are under construction, which will make it possible to connect the center with sleeping areas and the annexed territories of the city. Today, 97% of all transactions in public transport in Almaty are non-cash. An automated dispatching control system with a GPS system and video cameras on buses was introduced, as well as a system of fines for complaints from passengers when subsidizing carriers. The city has a system of photo and video recording of traffic violations, 709 lanes are monitored, from next year a double increase in posts will begin.
      Recall, the Head of State pays special attention to the development of tourism. In the Address to the People of Kazakhstan "New Opportunities under the Fourth Industrial Revolution" it is noted that one of the promising sources for any region is the development of inbound and domestic tourism, which today creates every tenth job in the world. In this regard, the Government is carrying out comprehensive work on the development of infrastructure and the removal of barriers in the tourism industry. In 2019, the State Program for the Development of Tourism until 2023 will be developed for the first time. The main indicator of the program will be the increase in the share of tourism relative to GDP to 8%.

      At the Government meeting chaired by Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, the draft Concept of the State Program for Industrial and Innovative Development for 2020–2025, developed in accordance with the instructions of the Head of State given in the Address to the People of Kazakhstan "Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Income and Quality of Life."

      The Minister for Investments and Development Zhenis Kassymbek reported that the Concept envisaged such areas as the development of the “economy of simple things,” the saturation of the domestic market with domestic goods, support for exporters in the manufacturing industry and the implementation of large, breakthrough projects through private investment, including foreign ones.
      At the same time, Kassymbek noted that the continuity with the Strategic Plan-2025 has been ensured, and key initiatives and principles have been taken into account.
      According to the Ministry for Investments and Development, the main provisions and approaches to the Concept were developed in close cooperation with Atameken National Chamber of Entrepreneurs and industry associations. So, in October 2018, the draft Concept was reviewed and generally approved at a meeting of the Expert Council on Economy. The main approaches to the Concept were also presented to the deputies of the Majilis of the Parliament.
      “In general, industrial policy will maintain continuity and will focus on the development of the manufacturing industry. We will make maximum use of the existing infrastructure and institutional framework,” the minister assured.
      In addition, he noted that since the beginning of an active industrial policy, basic conditions for the development of the manufacturing industry have been provided.
      , an institutional framework has been formed: the Enterprise Code has been adopted, which combined all the tools for supporting entrepreneurs, and determined the functions of development institutions. The creation of the Baiterek Holding and the development of specialized support institutions made it possible to cover all aspects of the manufacturing industry.
      , the system support for the processing industry continues through the development of the necessary industrial infrastructure – 12 special economic zones have been created, three of which already have full infrastructure readiness (Innovative Technology Park, Ontustyk and Khorgos-Eastern Gate). There are 22 industrial zones with fully or partially completed infrastructure, seven industrial zones are at the construction stage, 9 are at the design stage.
      In addition, systematic work is underway to develop human capital. Within the framework of the second five-year plan, 11 basic higher education institutions for personnel training were defined.
      , the modernization of existing enterprises and the implementation of new investment projects in the basic sectors – metallurgy, oil refining and chemical industry.
      , the manufacturing industry is expanding the range of manufactured products in metallurgy, mechanical engineering, chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and the construction industry.
      The approaches to the Concept of the Third Industrialization Program are based on key challenges for further qualitative growth and sustainable competitiveness of the manufacturing industry: insufficient investment in fixed capital, an unformed critical mass of enterprises, low “complexity” of products.
      The goal of industrial innovation policy is to stimulate the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry in the domestic and foreign markets. This goal will be achieved by solving three problems:
       
      For the successful achievement of the goals and objectives, the ministry offers to work in five areas of industrial and innovative development.
      Kassymbek stressed that the Third Industrialization Program will differ from the two previous five-year plans. First, a transition will be made from industry priorities in favor of supporting efficient producers in all sectors of the manufacturing industry. Second, efforts will be focused on the development of new, expansion and "complication" of the existing range of products, including consumer goods. Third, direct support will be provided in exchange for the counter obligations of the business to achieve specific indicators (modernization, export growth, etc.). Fourth, as part of preparing the industry for the digital age, the necessary infrastructure and standards will be created.
      “We will continue to support enterprises based on a balanced development model. Enterprises will receive comprehensive support at all stages of their development – from a beginner to a successful enterprise,” said Kassymbek, noting that further attention will be paid to three groups of enterprises.
      The first group “Strong rear” is manufacturing enterprises, due to which the volumes and assortment of domestic products, including consumer goods, will be increased, and a pool of future exporters will be created.
      The second group is "Competitive Manufacturers." These are the existing exporters, their tasks: expanding the nomenclature and increasing the complexity of the export basket.
      The third group, “Gravity Centers,” includes large, capital-intensive projects, including in the basic industries, as well as with the participation of TNCs and foreign investors. At the expense of them, the production of new types of industrial semi-finished products will be assured and the necessary raw materials will be provided.
      According to the results of the Third Industrialization Program, it is planned to achieve the following main indicators in the manufacturing industry by 2016:
      According to Kassymbek, the voiced approaches to the Concept of the Third Industrialization Program will strengthen the work on further increasing value added in the economy, “complicating” the produced basket of goods and expanding its presence in foreign markets.

      At the Government meeting chaired by the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, the progress of the implementation of the State Program for Development of the Agro-Industrial Complex for 2017–2021 was reviewed.

      The Head of State set before the agro-industrial complex the task to increase labor productivity and export of processed agricultural products at least 2.5 times within five years. Taking into account the tasks set in July 2018, the Government updated the State Program to 2021.
      First Vice Minister of Agriculture Arman Yevniev reported on the progress in implementing the updated state program. It should be noted that the implementation of the state program for the first time in pilot mode is managed using the project approach. For this purpose, a full-fledged project office has been created, which conducts operational control and spot monitoring of projects throughout their entire life cycle. The entire state program, in accordance with the standards of project management, has been decomposed into 10 sectoral, 14 regional programs, as well as interaction with other government agencies on the development of 10 related subprogrammes on the development of the agro-industrial complex and rural areas.
      Yevniev reported on the progress of the sectoral programs. The sectoral program for the development of animal husbandry has been implemented since the second half of this year and is based on small and medium-sized farms. For its implementation, a special preferential credit product “Sybaga” has been launched.
      “This year the plan has already been exceeded, despite the fact that we started its implementation only from the second half of the year. To date, over 600 farmers have received loans. The annual plan for the purchase of cattle by farms is 50 thousand heads. Over 11 months, applications for more than 67 thousand heads have already been received, loans for 55 thousand heads have been approved and granted. The plan for breeding broodstock conversion is 1 million heads. Already today, about 977 thousand heads or 98% are involved in the breed transformation,” Yevniev reported.
      According to the Ministry of Agriculture, for 11 months 2018, exports of beef amounted to 14.5 thousand tons. At the same time, Yevniev noted that by the end of the year the republic will exceed the planned 15 thousand tons of beef.
      The sectoral dairy program provides for an increase in milk production over 10 years by 1 million tons. Indicators of achieving the goal have been defined. By 2027 it is planned to open 527 new family dairy farms with a capacity of up to 400 heads, 139 industrial farms for 400 heads.
      “This year 15 dairy farms have already been commissioned. Of these, 10 are industrial with a total capacity of 7.4 thousand heads and 5 are family farms. By the end of 2018, additional input of 10 farms is planned with a total capacity of 4.5 thousand heads. As a result of the implementation of the program with the same amount of state support, by increasing its efficiency, the volume of milk production only in organized farms for 10 months amounted to 1.3 million tons. For comparison, in 2015 they produced 900 thousand tons,” Yevniev said.
      According to the Ministry of Agriculture, it is precisely the organized farms that give the main milk growth. So, for 10 months they produced milk by 7.8% more than in 2017. And this is real, counting milk, which is received for processing. At the same time, personal subsidiary farms yielded a growth of only 1.9% over the same period.
      As part of the sectoral program of the poultry industry, it is necessary to increase the level of poultry meat production by three times over the next 10 years and thereby ensure import substitution. This year, the Makinsk Poultry Factory project has already been launched with an annual capacity of 60 thousand tons. This is the most ambitious project at this stage in the poultry industry.
      Yevniev noted that the largest reserve in crop production exists in the development of irrigated agriculture. The state program envisages the involvement of 610 thousand hectares until 2021, including 65 thousand hectares in 2018, of which 42 thousand hectares of irrigated land have been introduced today. The remaining area will be introduced before the late 2018. In general, for the implementation of this task, jointly with the Islamic Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, projects are being implemented to restore the irrigation and drainage systems of the irrigated lands in demand on an area of ​​128 thousand hectares for more than 100 billion tenge.
      In addition, within the framework of this sectoral program, additional 1.5 million hectares of new irrigated lands are planned to be brought into circulation, bringing the area up to 3.5 million hectares. Thus, the share of irrigated land in the total sown area will be 16%, and the gross output at 2.4 trillion tenge. Irrigation farming is not only vegetables and fruits, it is also guaranteed feed for livestock.
      As part of the sectoral program for the development of intensive gardening, the task has been set for 10 years to lay out intensive gardens on an area of ​​47 thousand hectares and thereby ensure import substitution. In addition, related areas will be developed: the construction of fruit storage facilities, the creation of nurseries and laboratories for the production of virus-free seedlings, the reloading of processing facilities. The main regions where intensive gardens are located are Almaty, Zhambyl and Turkestan regions.
      In addition, Yevniev reported on the progress in the implementation of a number of system tasks aimed at providing the agro-industrial complex with the necessary resources. So, to increase the accessibility of the subjects of the agro-industrial complex to financing, specific measures are envisaged.
      First, this year the subsidized interest rates on loans for fixed assets, as well as the leasing of agricultural equipment and agricultural animals, have been resumed.
      “Only in 10 months 2018, this allowed us to lend 2,752 equipment units worth over 50 billion tenge. For comparison, for the entire last year, 2,400 vehicles worth 40.2 billion tenge were leased. And this is taking into account the fact that the program began its implementation in the second half of 2018. In general, in 2018, it is planned to allocate up to 60 billion tenge for leasing programs,” Yevniev informed.
      Second, the approaches to investment subsidies have been changed. Now the share of compensation for investments is equalized on all passports to 25%, with the exception of infrastructure projects for irrigation of pastures, where the percentage of compensation will remain at 80%.
      “This gave impetus to the initiation of new investment projects. If for the entire last year, 40 large investment projects worth 45.1 billion tenge were approved through Kazagro, then from the beginning of the current one – 76 projects worth 104.5 billion tenge,” he said.
      Third, in the framework of improving the efficiency of state support, ineffective subsidies are being reduced, such as, according to Yevniev, include hectare subsidies in crop production, subsidizing of productivity in animal husbandry. The results of the reform showed that of the 54 types of subsidies, 34 will remain, which will be simplified and fully automated by the end of 2018. This will reduce the time for consideration of applications by an average of 2.5 times and reduce corruption risks. In 2018, for the first time, the process of issuing subsidies for mineral fertilizers is fully automated.
      Work is also continuing to involve financial institutions in financing the agrarian sector by funding them through KazAgro Holding. For two years, the volume of loans in this area increased from 21% to 37%. Since the beginning of 2018, the holding has funded financial institutions for 82.3 billion tenge.
      Meanwhile, the loan guarantee system is being improved, so from 2019 guarantees up to 30% of the loan amount can be obtained by small and medium businesses in priority agricultural areas and which lack development collateral. The relevant rules were adopted.
      In addition, as Yevniev emphasized, work is underway to improve insurance systems in agriculture and credit partnerships, and a new financial instrument– an agrarian receipt – is being introduced. To this end, a package of amendments to legislative acts has been formed, which is under consideration in the Majilis of the Parliament.
      In addition, for the development of science, education and dissemination of knowledge in order to improve the quality of scientific research in the current year, structural changes were carried out in the system of the National Agricultural Research and Education Center. Based on the experience of the countries that most successfully use innovations in the agro-industrial complex. These are the USA and Brazil, where the main emphasis is placed on the transfer of science to applied tasks and targeted training of scientists.
      “This year, program-targeted funding has been increased by 1.8 times from 4.2 billion tenge to 7.6 billion tenge. In addition, since this year, for the first time business associations have participated in making decisions on the financing of scientific research topics for the next three years. The next step will be the formation of the market demand for research through the introduction of co-financing subsidies. 4.1 billion tenge was allocated for updating the material and technical base of scientific organizations,” Yevniev said.
      As the first vice minister of agriculture informed, the new knowledge dissemination system will rely on the system of agroparks and regional centers, which will carry out the agro-maintenance, transfer of the necessary technologies for the farmers of the region, their observance and necessary technological solutions based on regional centers.
      “In order to ensure the availability of sales markets and export development, measures are being taken to protect the domestic market and expand foreign markets. The Chinese market is open to many agricultural products (fish products, breeding horses, frozen lamb, honey, wheat, wheat bran, soybeans, slaughter horses, rapeseed meal, beef, alfalfa hay, flour, vegetable oil, barley, corn). Due to these measures, in the first nine months, exports of agricultural products to China increased by 42%,” Yevniev said.
      Veterinary requirements for the supply of live sheep, frozen and chilled lamb, beef, and edible eggs are agreed with the Iranian side. This year, the Ministry of Agriculture plans to harmonize the requirements for live cattle.
      Restrictions on the supply of cattle and small ruminants to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as meat and meat products, chicken eggs in the UAE, have been lifted. In Kazakhstan 171 enterprises are included in the Registers of foreign countries that have the right to export agricultural products. For example, 153 enterprises received the right to export to China for various types of agricultural products, 17 fish processing enterprises have permission to export fish products to the European Union.
      According to Yevniev, the International Epizootic Bureau filed a dossier on the division of the territory of nine areas free of foot and mouth disease without vaccination into five zones, which will simplify international trade. Negotiations are planned with the veterinary and phytosanitary services of Israel, Kuwait, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, and the European Union countries on the possibility of supplying Kazakhstani agricultural products. As a result, exports of agricultural products for the nine months increased by 28.3%, including exports of processed products increased by 10%.
      As part of the program of digitization of the agro-industrial complex, electronic field maps are being created, which are a key element of precision farming, 24 million hectares of arable land, or 100% of the total sown area, and 24.6 million hectares of pastures or 35% are digitized. By the end of the year it is planned to complete the full digitization of fields on pastures.
      “According to the automation of the subsidy process from 15 types of subsidies, 3 subsidies (fertilizers, herbicides, hectares) were launched with full automation of the process. The blockchain technology was launched in the electronic grain receipts, which made it possible to ensure the security of operations with grain receipts in the amount of 5 million tons of grain,” said Yevniev.
      Yevniev also reported that the measures and indications of sectoral programs were cascaded into regional programs. To date, all areas have developed and defended their programs.
      “In order to monitor the implementation of the state program in the regions this year, instead of 103 indicators, which were previously monitored in the regions, a rating of regions by 30 indicators has been developed, aimed at encouraging regional leaders to take measures to increase labor productivity,” Yevniev assured.
      According to the Ministry of Agriculture, in the country as a whole, there has been an increase in the volume of attracted investments in the fixed capital of agriculture, for 10 months it was 18.4%, and in food production – 34%. In plant growing continued diversification of acreage.
      In turn, the chairman of the board of KazAgro Rustem Kurmanov said that according to the results of 10 months, the volume of funding of financial organizations amounted to 83 billion tenge, or 30% of the total lending. By the end of the year it is planned to reach the figure of 37%.
      “In terms of increasing the level of technical equipment and intensification of production in the agro-industrial complex, 2,752 units of equipment worth 50 billion tenge were leased, which is 20% more than in 2017,” said Kurmanov.
      Also, the akims of the Zhambyl region – A. Myrzakhmetov, the Turkestan – Zh. Tuymebayev, Akmola – M. Murzalin, the West Kazakhstan – A. Kulginov, Mangystau – E. Tugzhanov also reported on the implementation of the state program in the regions.
      Deputy Prime Minister – Minister of Agriculture Umirzak Shukeyev said that a new sectoral program for the development of irrigated land is ready, which will be submitted to the Government in December. This program will include issues of subsidizing equipment for greenhouses.
      This year, the state program for 2017–2021 was implemented at an intensive pace. And due to the fact that the agro-industrial sector is a fairly extensive area and has many areas, this program provides for the implementation of specific projects. At the level of the Ministry of Agriculture, work is carried out within the framework of project management. As a result, the entire program for the development of the agro-industrial complex should consist of specific projects: at the rural, district, and regional levels.
      Summing up the consideration of the issue, Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev outlined the positive dynamics of changes in the indicators of the state program, while noting the lag behind the intended results in a number of areas. In this regard, the Ministry of Agriculture, together with the Akimats, is entrusted with the end of the year to ensure the achievement of all target indicators and the positive dynamics of the main indicators of the development of the agro-industrial complex.
      At the end of the year, the Government meeting will hear reports of regional akims on the work carried out as part of the project management on agriculture and the digital economy.

      At the Government meeting chaired by Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, the Plan for the Development of Irrigated Lands until 2028 was reviewed. The draft Plan was presented by the First Vice Minister of Agriculture Arman Yevniev.

      The main goal of the program is to provide irrigated land with water on an area of ​​3.5 million hectares. At present, the area of ​​irrigated land is 1.4 million hectares. The implementation of the Plan envisages the restoration of out-of-turn but demanded irrigated lands on an area of ​​600 thousand hectares and the introduction of new 1.5 million hectares. At the same time, gross output will be 3.7 trillion tenge.
      Yevniev reported that in order to develop the irrigation infrastructure further, the Ministry of Agriculture proposed to switch to a financing model with private investment in PPP schemes taking into account the world experience. According to him, this will allow improving the efficiency of land use, increasing the accumulated surface water resources, creating anchor enterprises and expanding the export of agricultural products.
      The presented public-private partnership model provides for a private partner that establishes a special financial company to attract investments from international financial organizations, the Unified Accumulative Pensions Fund or second-tier banks under the guarantee of the Ministry of Finance.
      “The expected results of the implementation of the program on the restored and re-introduced irrigated lands by 2028 provide for the growth of gross revenues to 3,727 billion tenge, an increase in output by 1 employee to 5.8 million tenge,” reported Yevniev.
      The first vice minister also said that the conceptual approaches of this program were worked out with representatives of the business community. Many enterprises and final agricultural producers have expressed interest in the project.
      Business representatives have also attended the Government meeting.
      Country Director of the Asian Development Bank in Kazakhstan Giovanni Capannelli said that the Bank will soon complete work on a large Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Agriculture on investing up to $2 billion in the sector for 2019-2021. The main component of this memorandum is a focus on supporting the modernization of irrigation sites.
      In his turn, Director of Tamas LLP A. Pussurmanov stated that, as an investor, he fully supports this approach, where the private partner, from the start of implementation, will independently organize and implement design and construction activities, and after completion, the operation and maintenance of plant systems providing irrigation water services that will be used for the first time in Kazakhstan. It should be noted that this enterprise, following the results of a survey of irrigated lands on an area of ​​25 thousand hectares in the city of Arys of the Turkestan region, expressed interest in the project.
      Director of Atakent-Agro LLP B. Malimov said that the introduction of new irrigated lands into circulation is a popular and relevant project, the proposed tariffs are acceptable. The lands that the Ministry of Agriculture plans to develop are less watered and show more efficiency than the more watered areas that are saline and located near groundwater, which force them to use additional work.
      During the consideration of the issue, Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Agriculture Umirzak Shukeyev noted that this program of irrigated land development is very important for the republic. Because today irrigated land makes up 7% of the total cultivated area. Despite this, 40% of the gross agricultural product is produced on this irrigated land. All entrepreneurs understand the benefits of irrigated land: from year to year the number of irrigated lands increases. In 2018 alone, 65 thousand hectares were commissioned. Most of them are in the North Kazakhstan, Aktobe regions. But, according to Shukeyev, this dynamic should be strongly increased.
      If within the framework of the Development Plan for 10 years the area of ​​irrigated land will reach 3.5 million hectares, then in the future 70% of agricultural products will be grown on these lands. The increase in the area will allow agricultural producers not to depend on weather conditions.
      Akims of Almaty region A. Batalov, Aktobe – B. Saparbayev, Mangistau – Y. Tugzhanov reported on the development of irrigated agriculture in the regions.
      As a result of consideration of the issue, Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev noted that the draft Plan was agreed with all interested ministries and regions. Conceptual approaches to its implementation have received support from the private sector.
      In general, the plan is designed to supply 3.5 million hectares with irrigation water, which will give gross output increase of 4.5 times and create 300 thousand jobs. Ministry of Agriculture together with the interested state bodies and akims was instructed to provide quality and timely implementation of the plan’s measures.

The Minister for Investments and Development Zhenis Kassymbek reported on the progress of introducing digital technologies into socially significant areas.

      At the meeting of the Government chaired by Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, issues of digitization in the construction and utilities sectors were considered. The Minister for Investments and Development Zhenis Kassymbek reported on the progress of introducing digital technologies into socially significant areas.
      According to the Minister for Investments and Development, the digitization of housing and public utilities is necessary to achieve transparency in the activities of all participants in the sector, provide social satisfaction, improve the quality of services provided. In order to ensure the confidence of citizens in the sector, it is necessary to first arrange residential buildings.
      Kassymbek indicated that this is a full-scale installation of smart metering devices with the ability to transfer data. According to the information of local executive bodies in the country, the apportionment of apartment houses is 45%. About 50 thousand of communal home utilities registering devices, about 62 thousand additional devices are needed.
      Today, according to the data of the Ministry of Education and Science, when installing general heat metering devices without an automatic heat supply station, the payment for heat of a two-room apartment with an area of ​​60 m² will drop to 36% or an average of 2,720 tenge. On a national scale, this savings in monetary terms can reach 32.5 billion tenge per year.
      As an example, Kassymbek provided data from the receipt of an apartment of 29.8 m² in Aktobe. As can be seen from the receipt, in October 2017 the amount for heating amounted to 3,547 tenge. After the installation of heat metering devices and an automatic heat supply station in October 2018, the amount for heating was 466 tenge, i.e. the savings were 3,081 tenge.
      “For the full-scale introduction of general-purpose heat metering devices and automatic heat points, we are preparing a package of documents on attracting investments and funds from second-tier banks,” said the minister.
      At the same time, today the Unified Information System of the housing stock and housing and public utilities under the title “e-SHANYRAQ” has been created in pilot mode. The system will allow residents to participate in the management of the house online, ensuring transparency, monitoring the exchange of funds and their intended use in the accounts of the management company. Residents in real time will be able to verify the correctness of billing, based on meter readings and approved tariffs.
      “As part of the pilot project, it was planned to connect 190 multi-apartment residential buildings to e-SHANYRAQ until the end of 2018. By the end of the year, we plan to connect to the system about 2 thousand technical passports of multi-residential buildings and more than 4 thousand metering devices, 100% connection is expected in 2022,” said Kassymbek.
      According to the Minister for Investments and Development, with a view to putting e-SHANYRAQ into commercial operation, changes in legislation are envisaged. So, at the moment, changes to the draft law “On Housing Relations” are under consideration in the Parliament of Kazakhstan.
      In addition, the introduction of new technologies is planned. To date, areas in Kazakhstan have already been identified in Astana, Almaty, Atyrau and Taraz for the implementation of pilot projects. As Kassymbek informed, Nov. 30 the German company Merus began a pilot project on the application of anti-corrosion technologies in Astana, together with Astana-Teplotranzit JSC, on a 24-km-long steel pipe. The possibility of implementing a pilot project on the application of anti-corrosion technologies of the Japanese company Mitsui &amp; Co in Almaty is also being studied.
      “According to the test results, a decision will be made on the large-scale implementation of technologies and on the production of this equipment in Kazakhstan. Using anti-corrosion technologies, it is possible to reduce the final cost of upgrading 100 km of networks from an average of 16 billion tenge to 2.4 billion tenge and extend the life cycle of heating networks to 30 years,” noted Kassymbek.
      The implementation of the above proposals, according to the forecasts of the Ministry for Investments and Development, will allow to achieve, according to preliminary estimates, the cumulative effect from 2.4 trillion tenge to 3.9 trillion tenge. The load on the state budget will decrease by 6.7 times. By reducing losses on networks up to 9%, a saving of 52.7 billion tenge per year is expected. Saving primary resources will make it possible to reduce CO₂ emissions to 5.8 million tons per year. A reduction in the energy consumption of the housing and utilities sector to 17% is expected due to a reduction in losses in the heating networks. This will free up additional capacity for the economy.
      In general, to implement the above proposals, as noted by Kassymbek, it is necessary to carry out a complete inventory of apartment houses and other facilities over the next year, ensure that all natural monopolies are connected to the unified information system of the housing stock and utilities, implement an energy service contract, develop new mechanisms financing and introduction of equipment, uniform technical requirements for metering devices, as well as to strengthen the mechanisms of tariff incentives for the use of new technologies.
      In addition, in digitization of the construction industry, as part of the implementation of the instructions from the Head of State, the quality control of the construction sector is being strengthened. Currently, documents are being transferred from traditional paper media to electronic format, which will create transparency of business processes in construction. To solve this problem, a “Single digital portal” has been created, the information system of which is being tested in pilot mode at real sites in the city of Astana. The main participants in the construction process are the contracting organization, technical and design supervision, which, using the electronic signatire, gain access to the specified portal and carry out functions within their competence. Also, one of the advantages is the ability to connect to the system of all interested government agencies.
      “The portal covers all stages of construction — from the excavation to the completion of construction. All hidden works will not only end with acts, but also be stored in photo and video format. It should be noted that the portal allows you to track the use of materials of domestic production with the help of the entrance control journal,” said Kassymbek.
      In addition, in real time, you can watch a video broadcast from the construction site. The system will also ensure quality control at all stages of construction, including the procedure for commissioning the facility. Each participant will be able to electronically sign the appropriate declaration, a quality statement, a statement on the compliance of the work performed, after which the customer signs the facility acceptance certificate and sends it to the State Corporation for registration with one click.
      Thus, the introduction of the “Single digital portal” will significantly improve the quality of construction and transparency of processes. Applied during the construction of equipment for photo and video fixation after commissioning of the facility will be connected to the citywide video surveillance system. As part of the pilot project, the information system is being finalized. After all the relevant procedures have been completed, it is planned to put this portal into commercial operation in 2019.
      Deputy Prime Minister Askar Zhumagaliyev noted that the Unified Information System for Housing and Public Utilities e-SHANYRAQ has already begun its work in pilot mode. Starting next year, technologies such as production Internet, blockchain and Big Data will be introduced. Legislation is being introduced in this direction. Land issues are being considered in the direction of digitalization of construction, business processes have been optimized. For example, the procedure for obtaining a construction license has been reduced from 15 to 5 days. In order to automate building processes, road maps have been approved. In addition, as part of these projects, several domestic IT solutions have been implemented. In 2019, these services will be provided only online. In other areas, work will continue.
      Akims of the Atyrau region — Nurlan Nogayev and the city of Almaty — Bauyrzhan Baibek reported on the work carried out in the regions.
      Following the consideration of the issue, the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev noted that the work is being done in the right direction, and also instructed the Ministry for Investments and Development to complete all pilot projects in the housing and utilities sector by the end of the year and calculate the economic effect.
      However, it is entrusted to pay special attention to quality parameters. Reducing electricity tariffs should not affect the quality of work of natural monopolies. Investment program commitments must be met.

      Minister of Finance Bakhyt Sultanov reported that in 2017, out of 18 million services, the ministry electronically provided about 16 million services or 88%.
      "Until the end of 2018 it is planned to transfer 6 state services exclusively to the electronic format (without the participation of the human factor), to reduce the terms of rendering and the list of documents 25 state services. Work is underway to translate electronic tax returns into a web portal and mobile application E-Government," Sultanov informed.
      As a result, the share of services rendered in electronic form will be brought to 95%. Such services as tax filing, verification of excise marks and fiscal checks will be available as an open interface for the development by private IT companies of their own applications and services.
      With the introduction of the Centralized Unified Personal Accounts system, the time for providing information on the availability of tax debts was reduced from three days to several minutes (more than 5 million certificates are issued annually).
      Sultanov said that thanks to the centralization of personal accounts, the cases of erroneous payment of taxes were reduced three times, which led to the exclusion of unjustified accrual of penalties, it became possible to carry out an auto-offset from the tax to another tax without the application of the taxpayer.

      Chairman of the National Bank Daniyar Akishev in his speech focused on the fact that the financial sector is one of the key industries where digital technologies are actively used. Thus, according to him, today almost all banks of Kazakhstan have introduced a system of remote banking. Mobile banking services are provided by 60% of banks (20 second-tier banks), which serve almost 90% of the entire client base of banks. In these systems, about 10 million users are registered, of which about 30% (3 million) regularly conduct operations.

Amendments were approved by the Senate Parliament June 21, 2018. At present, the amendments are on the signature of the Head of State.
      Since this issue will provide access only to information systems of state bodies to the second tier banks, Abayev expressed the need to provide data on the second tier banks to the information systems of state bodies (Bank2Gov).
      "At the moment, the National Bank is working on the integration of the state databases of legal entities and individuals with the gateway of the National Bank. In order to avoid duplication of the existing integration of information systems, we consider it advisable for the National Bank to work out the issue of technical implementation of the integration of Gov2Bank and Bank2Gov in a comprehensive manner, taking into account compliance with all legislative norms," Abayev said.

      According to the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development, in order to ensure the safety and quality of products in the domestic market and create conditions for export, in 2018, the Laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Standardization” and the accompanying legislative changes were adopted. To reorient the business to new requirements, the effective date of the laws is from April 11, 2019.
      The adopted law on standardization is based on the experience of European countries and creates conditions for the transition to an international model of standardization and includes:
      In addition, as part of the implementation of the tasks of the Third State Program of Industrial-Innovative Development, it is supposed to define standards for each product group, which will allow manufacturers to focus on high quality.
      In general, according to Minister Kassymbek, the amendments are aimed at introducing an international model for the development of calibration of measuring instruments, that is, improving the quality of products.
      “A plan to eliminate technical barriers in product promotion has been prepared. The key activities are: the study and coordination of requirements for processed products, adaptation of standards, as well as preparation of a base of accredited testing centers for attracting foreign certification bodies applying for accreditation in the Kazakhstani system. Currently, the implementation of this plan has already begun,” Kassymbek summarized.
      It should be noted that an action plan to eliminate technical barriers to product promotion has been prepared jointly with the ministries of healthcare and agriculture.
      Thus, the Minister of Healthcare Yelzhan Birtanov reported on the ongoing work on monitoring the safety of products for compliance with the technical regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union.
      Currently, the Ministry of Healthcare monitors compliance with the requirements of 20 EAEU technical regulations, 10 of them on food safety, 6 — on the safety of non-food products and 4 — with other state bodies. For four years there has been a tendency to reduce the total number of non-conforming products in the consumer market. Thus, for the period from 2015–2018, the percentage of decline was from 26% to 14%.
      “As part of the monthly monitoring of product safety in 2018, the purchase covered about 70 thousand product samples, out of which 9,740 do not meet the requirements of technical regulations according to the results of laboratory examination. Of this, 69% are non-compliant with manufacturers for labeling, 23% — do not comply with safety requirements, inconsistencies in physical and chemical indicators — 7.2%,” reported Birtanov.
      Falsification was identified in 99 samples of dairy products on the content of vegetable fat and 143 samples of sausages. In general, according to the results of monitoring the safety of products, the main volume of non-conforming products — 66% falls on imported products, and 34% falls on products of domestic manufacturers.
      To eliminate the revealed violations, more than 2 thousand orders were issued, and in 2017 — 1,166, 877 cases of administrative offenses were initiated, and 193 court orders were issued. More than 22 tons of hazardous products were removed from sale and destroyed (in 2017 — 20.5 tons). Fines were imposed totaling more than 70 million tenge, in 2017 — 44.3 million tons. The Committee on Public Health of the Ministry sent materials to 18 producers of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus for which veterinary and sanitary measures were taken, including enhanced laboratory control.
      Thirty notifications were sent to the authorized bodies of the EAEU Member States regarding the identified non-conforming products for them to take appropriate measures.
      Along with this, following the results of cameral control, the court suspended the activities of 47 participants in foreign economic activity, and since August 2018 the importation of children's toys in the conditional release mode has been prohibited. In general, the volume of imported goods in the conditional release mode decreased from 47% to 8.6%.
      The Ministry of Healthcare has strengthened the work on informing about products that pose a risk to life and health. More than 4 thousand media coverage events were held, which is two times more than in 2017.
      “A committee will be created at the Ministry of Healthcare with the task of controlling the quality and safety of goods and services that affect human health, the quality of medical services in the circulation of drugs and medical devices, including monitoring compliance with retail limit prices in pharmacies, ensuring the sanitary and epidemiological welfare of the population. The organizational arrangements for the creation of the committee and its territorial divisions will be completed in April 2019,” added Birtanov.
      Vice Minister of Agriculture Berik Beisengaliyev reported that the ministry fulfills its functions of lifting restrictions with China, the countries of the Persian Gulf and other export-oriented countries. As a result, veterinary-sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions on priority types of goods are removed.
      According to the Ministry of Agriculture, it is necessary to begin negotiations with priority countries to determine the requirements and conditions for market access for Kazakhstani products. At the same time, to solve the question of concluding an agreement on their mutual recognition of the results of conformity assessment. For products that are positioned as being healthy, it is also necessary to negotiate access to such products. For the possibility of ensuring free access and application of standards by domestic manufacturers, the conclusion of appropriate agreements is necessary. Provide for the translation of foreign standards.
      “We understand that Kazakhstan’s certificates of conformity at the initial stage will not be recognized in foreign markets. In this regard, as an operational measure, it is necessary to involve internationally recognized conformity assessment bodies operating in the EU, US and PRC markets. To do this, the Committee for Technical Regulation and Metrology of the Ministry of Infrastructure needs to simplify and reduce the time required for accreditation of such bodies in Kazakhstan,” said Beisengaliyev.
      In addition, to ensure a coherent policy and centralization of state export support measures, it is necessary to resolve issues related to the Kazakh brands “Made in Kazakhstan,” “Qazaq Organic Food,” “KazMeat,” “Halal Kazakhstan,” “KazMai.” In particular, the mechanism for the provision of these brands, the conditions and responsibility for their application.
      The Ministry of Agriculture is also proposing measures to regulate issues related to the production and sale of products with declared special properties or qualities. For example, a unified policy in the field of halal industry. Separate structural divisions with targeted functions for agricultural and food products need to be created urgently under the Committee for Public Health of the Ministry of Healthcare and the Committee for Technical Regulation and Metrology of the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development. According to Beisengaliyev, the implementation of the tasks set will not only promote export promotion, but also stimulate the transition of domestic producers to modern production standards.
      During the meeting, the Chairman of the Board of the Atameken National Chamber of Entrepreneurs Ablay Myrzahmetov also made a report.
      According to him, in the third quarter 2018 more than 11 thousand goods were removed from imports, of which about 4% did not provide the appropriate certificates at the right time. In this direction, starting in 2019, the Chamber will issue industrial certificates to domestic entrepreneurs in a legal manner. Today, in conjunction with the Kazakhstan Industry Development Institute, work is underway to draw up a register of commodity producers with a nomenclature of products. This project, according to Myrzakhmetov, contributes to the development of Kazakhstan business.
      Following the consideration of the issue, the Prime Minister Sagintayev noted that today all the opportunities have been created, there are numerous benefits for the business. In this regard, public organizations need to strengthen the quality control of products presented on the domestic market. At the same time, it was entrusted to analyze the results of the work and, if necessary, raise the issue of returning some public services under state control.
      In addition, it was entrusted to work out questions on the promotion of domestic brands outside of Kazakhstan. The need for issuing certificates for both imported and exported products has been noted. In this regard, the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development was instructed to accelerate the adoption of necessary legislative measures aimed at improving state control, including the introduction of information systems and the mechanism for the seizure of counterfeit products. In addition, it is necessary to complete the work on consolidating the function of exercising state control over industrial products.

      October 2 at the regular meeting of the Government chaired by the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, Minister of Healthcare Yelzhan Birtanov reported on current issues in healthcare and measures for improving the quality of medical care in the framework of the Densaulyq State Program for 2016–2019.

      “All health issues currently raised by the public are reflected in the draft changes proposed to the Densaulyq State Program for 2016–2019, which we ask today to review and approve for implementation,” the minister said, noting that the Ministry of Healthcare analyzed official addresses, discussions and publications in the media and social networks. In addition, the most acute public health issues were considered at meetings of the Public Council. Recommendations from various NGOs were also taken into account.
      Thus, Birtanov notes that all key issues of the health care system were divided into six groups: the quality of services; lack of qualified personnel; drug supply, updating of medical equipment; as well as informing the public on the implementation of the Compulsory Social Health Insurance; transparency of the health care system; low level of health of citizens.
      In order to improve the quality of medical care, especially at the level of primary health care, the ministry plans to take a number of necessary measures within the framework of the State Program. So, by the end of 2019, the ministry will reduce the burden on the general practitioner through the creation of new sites and the development of small forms of primary health care, including through public private partnerships.
      “Until the end of 2019, local executive bodies need to reduce the workload to 1,700 people per doctor,” said Birtanov.
      As part of the further development of family practice, the clinical examination will be transformed into disease management programs that determine more than 60% of the causes of death.
      “By 2020, the coverage of disease management programs will be increased from 11% to 30% of patients registered for three diseases (arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic heart failure). In this regard, local executive bodies need to train all primary care physicians and nurses in this program by 2020,” the minister reported.
      In addition, Birtanov pointed out the need to continue the digitalization of the activities of all clinics through a full transition to a paperless turnover, thereby, it will reduce the unnecessary burden on medical staff.
      Another aspect of improving the quality of medical care is aimed at ensuring safe obstetric care and reducing maternal mortality. The state program provides for further professional development of medical workers, bringing staff of obstetricians and gynecologists and anesthesiologists and intensive care specialists to 95%.
      “Akimats need to ensure the hiring and retention of all the necessary specialists, as well as timely registration and dynamic monitoring of all pregnant women. In accordance with the network standard, ensure the integration of single-industry hospitals into multi-profile, including maternity hospitals and perinatal centers. It is necessary to fully equip medical organizations in accordance with the minimum standards. Local executive bodies need to provide training for all ambulance workers and hospitals, to introduce an approved standard,” said Birtanov.
      Regarding the quality of medical care, initiatives to improve the health care infrastructure are envisaged: this is the legislative consolidation of the competence of the ministry to approve the Single Perspective Development Plan (the draft law has been submitted to the Mazhilis of Parliament). The plan involves bringing the entire network of medical organizations to an approved standard in the country.
      Also it is planned to build 35 facilities for 31 billion tenge in 2018. In 2019 construction and installation works are planned at 33 facilities for an amount of 55.6 billion tenge, where private investment will be the source of financing for more than 60%.
      In the framework of improving staffing and raising the level of qualification of medical workers, since 2019 several activities have been planned within the framework of the State Program. Among them: the introduction of an additional exam for selection in medical universities and colleges; legislative consolidation of mandatory independent assessment of graduates. According to the Minister of Healthcare, the responsibility of akimats to provide measures of social support to young specialists will be strengthened (it is necessary to increase from 32% to 60%).
      “Dear akims! The issues of staffing in rural areas, their motivation, social support are in your hands! I’m asking you to take the sounded problems under personal control,” said Birtanov.
      One of the most pressing issues is the observance of the rights of citizens to drug provision. The state program provides for the provision of personalized electronic records of the issuance of all free medications. Also it is planned to launch a price control system for all drugs from 2019 and introduce a pilot drug tracking system. By 2020, there will be a full transition to electronic distribution of prescription drugs through the drug supply information system.
      As for the medical equipment updating, the creation of an information system of the National Medical Equipment Base, the purchase of 150 pieces of medical equipment within budgetary funds and PPP mechanisms as part of the Comprehensive Cancer Control Plan, and the introduction of online monitoring of the efficiency of medical equipment use are envisaged. In accordance with the Plan of the Nation "100 Steps" a fund for 100.5 billion tenge has been created. From January 1, 2018, the Fund is the sole purchaser of the Guaranteed Free Medical Care services.
      To increase the transparency of the healthcare system in the framework of digitalization, it is planned to launch a single interoperability platform for commercial operation, integrate all information systems; Paperless medical records in the industry from January 1, 2019; Synchronization of local electronic health passports with the national one. According to the Ministry of Healthcare, already today 10 million people have notes in the electronic health passport. By 2020, 100% of the population will have an electronic health passport.
      In accordance with the order of the Head of State, in May 2018 a plan of measures to manage public health was approved. The main directions of the plan are the promotion of a healthy lifestyle with an annual budget of 2.3 billion tenge and coverage of 10–12 million people. The propaganda highlights such provisions as reducing the consumption of sugar, salt, tobacco, and alcohol. Other measures to manage public health envisaged an increase in the effectiveness of preventive examinations of the population to cover up to 11.5 million people.
      Thus, in the new Densaulyq State Program the indicators “Life expectancy level” and “Level of satisfaction of the population” were revised upwards. Based on the methodology of the UN Development Program, the Health Index indicator has been revised. Three health indicators were excluded and other six were included. Also, 24 new measures were added.
      Birtanov stressed that it is necessary to increase the personal responsibility of the heads of local executive bodies in the implementation of the program. To create regional project offices at the local level for the implementation of the Densaulyq State Program’s measures.
      “It is a systematic approach to the activities of the State Program that will allow us to effectively carry out the tasks set and ensure the satisfaction of our citizens with the quality of medical care,” concluded Birtanov.
      Also in the course of the meeting, the heads of a number of regions, akims of the Mangystau region Yeraly Tugzhanov, Akmola — Malik Murzalin, Kyzylorda — Krymbek Kusherbayev, Almaty — Bauyrzhan Baibek, Atyrau — Nurlan Nogayev, North Kazakhstan — Kumar Aksakalov, Kostanay — Archimed Mukhambetov, deputy akim of the East Kazakhstan region Yerlan Aimukashev made reports on the ongoing work at the local level.

      October 16 at the Government meeting chaired by the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, the progress in the implementation of the President’s Five Social Initiatives was reviewed.

      On the first initiative, the Chairman of the National Bank Daniyar Akishev reported on the implementation of the 7–20–25 Program. The program was launched in July 2018. Kazakhstanis can purchase housing at the expense of a loan in tenge with an annual rate of 7%, an initial contribution of 20% and for a period of up to 25 years.
      “First of all, a person must choose housing according to the criteria defined in the program. Secondly, you need to come to the bank member and apply for a loan. Thirdly, it is necessary to have officially confirmed income and not to have housing on the right of ownership. Currently, seven banks are accepting applications,” said Akishev.
      To date, 2,352 applications worth 28 billion tenge have been approved for loans.
      “A quick start and successful implementation of the order of the Head of State is important. In a short time, the necessary infrastructure has been created, the information campaign has been expanded, and work is actively carried out with banks and the public. To improve the efficiency, the program was amended in September,” the head of the National Bank reported.
      Thus, the city of Shymkent and the suburban areas of Astana and Almaty are classified as regions with the maximum cost of purchased housing in the amount of 25 million tenge. The concept of primary housing has been expanded at the expense of residential real estate, implemented by akimats and construction investors. Measures to stimulate housing supply were adopted. The mechanism of purchase by the Baspana mortgage organization of tenge bonds of local executive bodies at a market rate for housing construction is provided.
      “The program has a social orientation in the form of a low interest rate and long loan terms, but it remains a mortgage. This means that you need to have officially confirmed income in order to repay the loan. For example, to buy an apartment worth 10 million tenge, you need a down payment of 2 million tenge. Monthly payment will be 57,000 tenge. Accordingly, a citizen must have an income of about 120 thousand tenge per month in order to obtain the approval of the bank. Because there is a rule that the payment of debt on a loan should not exceed half of the income,” said Akishev.
       
      As reported by the Minister of National Economy Timur Suleimenov, from January 1, 2019, the tax burden is reduced 10 times for workers with a salary of up to 25 MCI.
      “The norms developed will entail losses of local budgets in 2019–2021 in the amount of 93.7 billion tenge. Losses for 2019 (29.1 billion tenge) will be compensated for by the republican budget during the three-year transfers of 2017–2019,” he said.
      According to him, compensation for losses of local budgets is provided for under the draft law “On the Republican Budget for 2019–2021,” which is in the Parliament of Kazakhstan.
       
      As reported by the Minister of Education and Science Yerlan Sagadiyev, in pursuance of the instructions of the Head of State, additional 20,000 grants were allocated in 2018. The total number of grants for two years increased from 39 to 69 thousand, including 20,000 additional grants.
      “To date, they are all distributed. All grant holders started their studies. These are more than 51,000 students who are studying for undergraduate programs, 13,000 — for master's programs, more than 2,000 — for PhD. Exactly half of the grant holders, that is, 34,000 students are enrolled in technical specialties. Most of them are trained in the direction of information and communication technologies, cybersecurity, radio engineering and electronics. More than 5,000 grants were provided for under the Serpіn program for rural youth from labor-surplus regions,” the minister said.
      At the same time, about 20% of the grants are aimed at training teachers, including those with enhanced linguistic competences. The cost of training a specialist with a higher education in technical and agricultural specialties was increased from 346,600 tenge to 635,800 tenge. The cost of grants in all universities for technical and agricultural specialties increased from 346,600 tenge to the level of national universities and amounted to 635,800 tenge
      .
      “The President’s order regarding the increase in the number of grants has been fulfilled. In parallel with the increase in the number of grants, to improve the availability of higher education, the following measures are taken: organizing and conducting of the Unified National Testing several times during the year, providing opportunities for conditional enrollment of school graduates, enabling universities to receive foreign citizens, introducing scholarship programs for foreign citizens and implementing a new model admission to the master’s programs," said Sagadiyev, voicing the first results of the work. So, for example, 1,800 students who traveled abroad each year were reduced to 630 students, that is, three times.
      In addition, as reported by the minister of Education and Science, the mission is also being executed to provide students with places in the dormitories. To do this, all the necessary regulations were adopted, financing issues were resolved. Work on the construction of dormitories began in September 2018.
      “The draft of the republican budget for the upcoming three-year period supported 15 billion tenge for the placement of state orders. In total, 153 billion tenge for 10 years provided for 75,000 places. All necessary measures have been taken to address this need. All the priority projects implemented in the next five years are provided with land plots. In general, 166 land plots are provided, of which 116 belong to educational organizations, 50 land plots are allocated by akimats,” reported Sagadiyev.
      In relation to 24 land plots on which it is planned to introduce new places, design estimate documentation has already been prepared. Regarding 47 land plots, design and estimate documentation is under development.

      Feb. 19 at a meeting chaired by the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, a draft Government Resolution on budget lending to JSC Housing Construction Savings Bank and domestic automakers was approved. Minister of Industry and Infrastructure Development Zhenis Kassymbek reported on the considered issue.

      About 1.3 million depositors accumulated about 660.6 billion tenge in the Housing Construction Bank’s system. These investors are potential participants of the Nurly Zher State Program intending to improve their living conditions through state support measures. To date, 44.7 thousand investors have sufficient savings (over 20% of the apartment value) for 195.9 billion tenge.
      In 2018 the bank issued 38.3 thousand loans, which is 47% higher than in 2017. For 2019, within the framework of the Law “On the Republican Budget for 2019–2021,” the allocation of 28 billion tenge was supported. The budget loan will be provided by the bank for 20 years.
      Kassymbek noted that, in general, the housing savings system is one of the most acceptable tools for obtaining housing. Loans to investors are granted at a rate of not more than 5% per annum for a period of 25 years, with a down payment of not more than 20%.
      For example, the monthly payment for an apartment worth 8.4 million tenge (one bedroom apartment 60 m
      ) will be about 60 thousand tenge.
      The allocation of these funds will allow 3,111 investors to obtain affordable loans to improve their living conditions. These funds, in turn, will turn around for the next 15 years 3 times, which will ensure the issuance of loans to another 6 thousand depositors.
      The program of preferential car loans was launched in 2015 and is aimed at lending cars and leasing financing of commercial vehicles. For three years under this program, 13,992 vehicles were sold, including the leasing of 747 commercial vehicles.
      To further support measures for domestic automakers, as well as to ensure affordable lending to the population, the practice of using this tool will continue. In 2019 it is planned to allocate budget financing of Baiterek National Managiing Holding JSC for 10 billion tenge through preferential financing from the second tier banks, 8 billion of which will be used for preferential car loans, and 2 billion tenge for leasing financing of commercial vehicles.
      During the initial disbursement of funds, it is planned to sell more than 2 thousand cars. In subsequent years, due to the revolving funds, the indicator for the sale of domestic cars under the program will reach an average of 400-500 per year.
      According to the minister, the provision of a budget loan for 18 years will allow the automotive industry to achieve the following results:
      Thus, the draft resolution approves the main conditions for budget crediting of Baiterek Holding, which was approved by the ministries of finance, justice, and the national economy without comment. Financial resources for the project are provided for in the state budget and the project, as noted by Kassymbek, will not entail negative social, economic and / or legal consequences.
      Chairman of Baiterek Holding Aidar Arifkhanov reported that the funds allocated earlier had an impact on the steady growth in the production of domestic cars. In 2018, 32.3 thousand cars were produced. At the end of 2018, 28.2 thousand passenger cars with a “Made in Kazakhstan” label were sold. Taking into account the positive experience, in accordance with the program Nurly Zher and the law on the republican budget in order to ensure the turnover of financing the construction of credit housing in 2019 a budget loan of 28 billion tenge will be allocated. At the same time, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan plans to allocate a budget loan of 10 billion tenge.
      The akims of Astana Bakhyt Sultanov and Kostanay region Archimed Mukhambetov reported on the implementation progress of the preferential lending to the population in the regions of the country.

      Recall, the construction project of the Saryarka gas pipeline is aimed at ensuring the country's energy security, reliable and uninterrupted gas supply to the central and northern regions, as well as improving the environmental situation in general.
      Socio-economic effect:

      Jan. 15 at the Government meeting chaired by the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, the development of e-government and the provision of public services were considered.

      In the Address to the People of Kazakhstan “Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Incomes and Quality of Life,” the Head of State commissioned to switch 90% of all public services to electronic format by 2020.
      To date, there are 741 public services in the Register. As the Minister of Information and Communications Dauren Abayev reported, only 454 or 61% are available in electronic form. At the same time, 165 public services are available exclusively in electronic format. Among them, almost half are licenses and permits, as well as business subsidization services. This was done to eliminate administrative barriers to business. Over the past year, 64 new public services have been transferred to the electronic format.
      The main tool for the provision of electronic public services is the e-government portal. Currently, more than 8.5 million users are registered on e-GOV. In 2018, 30 million public services were provided. There are 588 public services in need of optimization. It was mandatory to consider the possibility of their transfer to electronic format, shortening the issuance period, the list of documents, the possibility of rendering in composite or proactive form, eliminating redundant procedures and approvals. Following the results of the work, 141 public services are to be transferred to electronic format, and measures are taken on 447 public services to reduce the time and documents required from citizens.
      For example, it is planned to transfer the issuance of the so-called "medical-list" to the electronic format. In addition to convenience, this contributes to the formation of an electronic health database of the nation. It is planned that Big Data technologies will allow for more effective implementation of health and pharmacology policies. In addition, the two public services “Child transfer to foster care” and “Assignment of cash payments to foster carers” were combined.
      According to the Ministry of Information and Communications, it is impossible to achieve 100% automation of public services. Since there are services that require the mandatory presence and participation of a specialist. For example, examination and provision of medical and pedagogical advice to children with disabilities. For such services, the possibility of maximum optimization of processes and terms will be worked out.
      In total, within the recommendations of the Interdepartmental Commission under the Government, 486 road maps have been approved so far. By the end of 2018, 76 public services have been optimized.
      Following the results of 2018, the procedures were simplified:
      First, the filing of an electronic application for obtaining a driver's license and registration of the vehicle. Since the launch, these services have been used more than 23 thousand times. Previously, the registration of transport took six hours, now it takes two hours. Registration for the sale of transport takes only 20 minutes. No need to submit documents on paper. The possibility of delivering finished documents and a license plate to a house has been realized through Kazpost. In addition, citizens are given the opportunity to choose any of the state numbers already manufactured.
      Second, the ability to check the availability of administrative fines on a single resource is implemented.
      Third, it is planned to continue work on the provision of public services in a proactive mode. We are talking about services for the establishment of disability, the appointment of benefits and social benefits, the provision of prosthetic and orthopedic care, and so on. This will allow the complex to provide the listed social services without the need to visit the PSC or service providers with disabilities.
      As regards the development of the mobile e-government application M-Gov, it is noted that today only 87 services are available through mGov. Users of the application are 1.3 million citizens. In 2018, 3.6 million services were provided through m-Gov.
      To improve the regulatory framework, a bill was drafted providing for more than 500 amendments to 43 Acts and 10 Codes aimed at optimizing 121 public services. Among them: optimization of marriage registration services (will reduce the period of registration of marriage from 1 month to 3 working days), automatic return of amounts overpaid by taxpayers, cancellation of over 3.5 thousand standards and regulations for regulating the provision of public services introduction of the concept of a “pilot project.” As a result of the measures taken, 80% of public services will be automated in 2019, and 90% in 2020. The number of documents submitted in paper form will reduce by 110 million per year.
      Recall, following a study on the development of e-government conducted by the UN, in 2018 Kazakhstan took the 39th place in the group with a high level of development. At the same time, by the level of maturity, the Kazakhstani electronic government is at the e-GOV 2.0 stage. Currently, within the framework of the Digital Kazakhstan state program, work is underway to reach the e-GOV 3.0 stage, mastered by such countries as South Korea, Australia, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden. It should be noted that the e-GOV 3.0 stage is characterized by the introduction of such elements as “Artificial Intelligence,” “Proactive Services,” “Digitized Vital Moments,” “Internet of Things” and others. In Kazakhstan, according to the ministry, a full transition to the e-GOV 3.0 stage is planned by 2021.
      Chairman of the State Corporation “Government for Citizens” Ablaykhan Ospanov reported that out of 741 services contained in the Register of Public Services through the State Corporation, 598 services are available. There are 325 front-offices, 16 specialized public service centers with six sectors in Kazakhstan, including four sectors in Almaty and two sectors in the Turkestan region, 70 mobile service centers and 1,656 branches of Kazpost JSC that take part in rendering public services. At the same time, to increase the level of use of electronic services by citizens, a full-scale transformation of the existing front offices is being carried out with the introduction of the 60/40 principle, instead of the previously adopted 20/80, where 80% of jobs were occupied by employees employed in the application process from citizens. In addition, to simplify the process of obtaining public services, a new mechanism for confirming the identity of service recipients was launched. Now citizens can get services using face recognition or fingerprint, thereby eliminating the need to use electronic digital signature or presenting an identity card.
      During the meeting, the akims of Akmola region M. Murzalin, East Kazakhstan — D. Akhmetov, Kostanay — A. Mukhambetov, akims of Astana city B. Sultanov, Almaty — B. Baibek made speeches on improving the quality of public services provided
      Following the consideration of the issue, the Prime Minister Sagintayev instructed to improve the quality of the work being done. It is noted that only 4,639 vehicles passed online registration, only 18 thousand people received a driver's license. Considering the usefulness of these services for the population, it is indicated that the reason for the low rates is poor explanatory work among the population. Sagintayev instructed to provide explanatory work on the digitalization of the public services sector, as well as on a regular basis to provide the population with the necessary digital skills.
      Along with this, it is necessary to improve the work on the provision of public services in electronic format. In particular, to increase the number of government services available in the mGov mobile application, using a one-time password without an electronic signature, on the basis of a single statement, and also ensure timely adoption of the necessary legislative changes. It is important for the people. In this regard, it was entrusted to designate target indicators within the project office with specific deadlines for converting public services to digital format.
      Sagintayev noted that issues of development of public services are under special control of the Head of State and are included in the Digital Kazakhstan State Program. Every year the Government reports to the President of Kazakhstan. At the end of 2018, it is also necessary to prepare a report on the work done. The Ministry of Information and Communications, together with the interested government agencies and the State Corporation, are instructed within a month to draw up a list of public services to be converted into electronic format in the current year. All central and local government agencies are instructed to take measures for the timely implementation of this list, to develop appropriate road maps, to ensure effective interagency cooperation, and system integration.
      In addition, the Ministry of Information and Communications and the State Corporation need to form an effective system for monitoring and analyzing the processes of rendering public services.

      Regular meeting of the Government chaired by the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev began with the consideration of the work to implement the President’s instructions given at the Security Council meeting Nov. 7, 2018. Minister of Energy Kanat Bozumbayev reported on the work being done to reduce electricity tariffs.

       
      Recall, at the Security Council meeting chaired by the Head of State, the issues of forming current tariffs for electricity and heat, as well as the activities of state bodies that control energy pricing were discussed.
      Bozumbayev reported that, in accordance with the Head of State’s instructions, the Ministry of Energy is completing work to establish an objective level of marginal tariffs for electric energy. Preliminary results of the work were submitted for consideration by the Working Group that includes Presidential Administration, the General Prosecutor's Office, government agencies and the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs. The proposed level of marginal tariffs for electricity were discussed at the meeting.
      “The weighted average electricity cost reduction as the sum of the two components from the level of current marginal tariffs is 25%. The ministry’s approach have been generally supported,” said Bozumbayev.
      In addition, at the meeting of the Working Group, the need to reduce the marginal value of the capacity tariff to ensure the electricity cost reduction for final consumers from 700 thousand tenge to 590 thousand tenge per 1 MW was raised.
      At the meeting, according to the Ministry of Energy, the official position of the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs was heard. This will allow to submit the appropriate draft order defining the criteria to the Ministry of Justice for approval and registration.
      “We expect to approve the new reduced power tariff level by the end of this week. This will help conduct centralized trading in the first decade of December 2018. According to the bidding results, marginal tariffs for electricity from energy producing organizations will be approved,” the Minister of Energy said.
      In addition, Bozumbayev noted the importance of two aspects: preserving the current price of coal for power plants and reducing the cost of its transportation with the exception of intermediary structures; reduction of tariffs for energy transmission and energy supplying organizations from Jan. 1, 2019, to the current value.
      With regard to commercial gas, the ministry has developed a draft Order providing for the reduction of marginal wholesale prices. According to estimates of the Ministry of Energy, the reduction of the marginal wholesale prices will cut the final prices from Jan. 1, 2019, for power plants using gas, from 12-22% depending on the region.
      At the moment, the Ministry of Energy is awaiting confirmation by the Natural Monopolies Regulatory Committee of the Ministry of National Economy of the level of marginal wholesale prices through appropriate calculations of retail prices for the fuel and energy complex for the generation of electricity and heat for the population.
      Based on the gas price cuts by the Ministry of Energy, the Committee on the Regulation of Natural Monopolies will adopt appropriate orders to reduce retail gas prices for power plants.
      Measures to reduce prices for electricity and commercial gas will be implemented after the approval of the relevant Ministry of Energy’s Decrees with their enactment Jan. 1, 2019.

      At the regular meeting of the Government chaired by Prime Minister Askar Mamin, a set of measures for developing the manufacturing industry as part of the “economy of simple things” was considered.

      On behalf of the Head of State, 400 billion tenge was allocated to support the manufacturing industry under the lending program. The development and support of business projects in the economy of simple things will allow to create 16 thousand jobs by 2025 and reduce the share of product imports from 59% to 37%. This will bring 1.1 trillion tenge of taxes to the budget.
      According to the Minister of Industry and Infrastructure Development Roman Sklyar, special attention in the economy of simple things is paid to the development of the construction, light and furniture industry.
      “To solve these problems, roadmaps for the development of these industries have been developed. They envisage measures to develop the resource base, protect the domestic market by improving the measures of customs administration and technical regulation, create national standards aimed at improving the quality of goods and services,” said Sklyar.
      In order to increase the sales of products of these industries and reload existing enterprises, in regulated purchases, an annual increase in the share of local content by 20% is additionally proposed. At the same time, the supplier will have to confirm its production capacity with an Industrial Certificate.
      In addition, measures will be taken to increase the representation of domestic goods in retail chains, to provide enterprises with highly qualified personnel, to attract investments in these industries to implement projects using advanced technologies.
      In general, the roadmaps provide for the implementation of more than 150 events, according to which, in the medium term, the share of local content for manufactured goods will increase by more than 50%, the quality of products will increase and the volume of counterfeit products will decrease.
      “The implementation of the proposed measures will allow to increase the production of building materials, products of light and furniture industry by 73 billion tenge annually,” said Sklyar.
      Minister of Agriculture Saparkhan Omarov, in turn, reported that the main task of the agro-industrial complex is to ensure food security, the most important component of which is the food industry. 200 billion tenge was allocated for lending to the agro-industrial complex. Credit funds will be provided for the production of about 118 priority types of processed agricultural products. Of the 200 billion tenge, 100 billion tenge will be spent on loans to projects in the processing of agricultural products, and 100 billion tenge — on agricultural production, which serves as raw materials for food and other manufacturing industries.
      In order to reduce the credit load on the subjects of the agro-industrial complex, the interest rate on loans issued will be subsidized. The Ministry of Agriculture have made necessary changes to the rules for subsidizing interest rates.
      Roadmap for the Development of the Food Industry Includes 26 events in six main blocks:
      “Over the past six years, the growth of the food industry has averaged 1.8% annually (30 billion tenge), an increase in agricultural production by an average of 3.2%. The inflows will increase production growth by 25 billion tenge annually, which will ensure the dynamics of the industry (food and raw materials production) up to 6%,” said Omarov.
      Chairman of the Board of the Association of Financiers of Kazakhstan Elena Bakhmutova informed about the positive dynamics of the implementation of the lending program for priority projects.
      “So, as of March 4, 2019, 116 projects for 72.2 billion tenge were submitted for consideration. Of these, eight projects for 5.9 billion tenge have already been approved. Eight second-tier banks intend to participate in the implementation of the program, the reception of documents has already begun in seven of them,” Bakhmutova noted.

      Nov. 26 at the Government meeting chaired by the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, Minister of Education and Science Yerlan Sagadiyev and Vice Minister of Culture and Sports Aktoty Raimkulova reported on the implementation of the State Program for the Development and Functioning of Languages ​​for 2011–2019.

      As Raimkulova noted, the country’s language policy is carried out in accordance with the law “On Languages ​​in the Republic of Kazakhstan” and the State Program for the Functioning and Development of Languages ​​for 2011–2019.
      In order to fulfill the instructions sounded in the Head of State’s article “Looking into the Future: Modernizing Public Consciousness,” the state program was supplemented with tasks to clarify the phased transition of the Kazakh language to the Latin script, improve spelling, and ensure accessibility to the public. The program provides for the achievement of 9 indicators and 12 effective factors.
      To date, a number of activities have been implemented under the State Program. In the country, active training of civil servants in three languages is organized. In accordance with the Agreement of Understanding between the Academy of Public Administration under the President of Kazakhstan and the Ministry of Education and Science, 558 people took language courses from central executive bodies in 2018 (in 2017 — 610 people). In order to preserve the linguistic capital of Kazakhstan in 2018, the state provided support for the study of the native language of 26 ethnic groups (in 2017 — 225).
      In total, the country has one state and 88 regional national centers for language studies. Training centers organize language courses in accordance with the law "On Language." More than 42 thousand people studied in the training centers in the first half of 2018. In 7 months of 2018, 52,245 people including 20,057 civil servants assessed their knowledge of the Kazakh language through the KazTest system.
      “According to the results of 9 months 2018, the share of total document circulation in the state language was 93%. Of these, 91% are in central executive bodies, 95% are in local executive bodies and 46% are in national companies,” reported Raimkulova.
      In order to expand the scope of the state language use in the country, the following sites operate: Tilalemi.kz portal, Atau.kz onomastic base, Emle.kz orthographic base, Termincom.kz base, Tilmedia.kz trilingual website, Balatili.kz children's website and Qujat.kz website, where you can find Kazakh-language examples of documents from all industries and examples of their correct filling.
      Also, according to Raimkulova, the Ministry of Culture and Sports conducted a monitoring of the terms approved today. Of the 21 thousand approved terms, 40.8% are own, 59.2% are borrowed and mixed.
      In order to preserve the purity of the Kazakh language and translate it into a scientific language, work began on determining the terminology principles and the main tasks of applied terminology. Under the Government of Kazakhstan, the Republican Terminology Commission that approves the terms was established.
      Raimkulova noted that the Kazakh versions of a number of terms that came from foreign languages ​​were revised, this work will continue. In addition, work is underway on onomastics. In the first half of 2018, 726 proposals of central and local executive bodies were considered, and positive conclusions were given on a number of proposals.
      In turn, the Minister of Education and Science Yerlan Sagadiyev reported on the ongoing work on the indicator "The Proportion of School Graduates who have Mastered the State Language at B1 Level." Thus, the Program provides for an increase in the share of school graduates who have mastered the state language at the B1 level in 2018 to 90%.
      In accordance with a special order of the Ministry of Education and Science, 11th grade students must pass a written exam in their native language and literature when passing state final examinations. In schools where instruction takes place in Russian, Uzbek, Uygur, and Tajik, testing for knowledge of the Kazakh language takes place. It should be noted that the grade “4” in the Kazakh language corresponds to the B1 level of mastering the language, and “5” — to the level of mastering the language at B2.
      In 2018, more than 45 thousand graduates received grades "4" and "5" — which is 90%. Thus, according to the information of the Ministry of Education and Science, the indicator has been fulfilled.
      Also, Sagadiyev reported on training the future teachers of the Kazakh language as part of the state educational order. In the 2018/19 academic year in the specialty "Kazakh Language and Literature," the state order was issued for 596 places, including 405 for bachelor's degree, 180 for master's degree, and two doctoral studies.
      In addition, to date, work is underway to introduce the standard practice of continuous education of the state language in the Kindergarten – School – College system.

      At the Government meeting chaired by the Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev, Minister of Energy Kanat Bozumbayev reported on the development of the fuel and energy industry over 11 months of 2018.

      According to the Ministry of Energy, for 11 months of 2018, the main indicators of the fuel and energy industry show a positive growth trend.
      The volume of oil and condensate production amounted to about 82.4 million tons, showing an increase of 4.9% compared to the corresponding period of 2017. As Bozumbayev noted, oil production in three large projects amounted to 49 million tons, including 12 million tons at the Kashagan field, 25.9 million tons at Tengiz, and 11.1 million tons at Karachaganak. Oil exports amounted to 66 million tons, which is 3.8% more than the same period in 2017
      “The volume of oil refining amounted to about 15 million tons, showing an increase of 8.6% compared to the same period of 2017, and 2.4% higher than the plan for 11 months. The volume of production of petroleum products (aviation kerosene, diesel fuel, fuel oil, gasoline) amounted to 10.6 million tons, showing an increase of 9.3% over the same period in 2017 and 3.9% of the plan for 11 months of this year,” reported Bozumbayev.
      In general, according to the minister, the situation in the oil products market is stable, there is no shortage of fuel. As of Dec. 10 in Kazakhstan, the average retail price for gasoline AI-92 is 154.8 tenge, for inter-seasonal diesel fuel — 193.2 tenge. The amount of fuel residues at the country's oil depots is enough to cover the needs of the domestic market: gasoline reserves of the Аi-92 — 267.5 thousand tons (for 30 days), and diesel fuel — 143.2 thousand tons (for 11 days).
      “Due to the disparity of retail prices for oil products at gas stations of the country compared to neighboring countries, there is evidence of high consumption of fuel and lubricants by transit transport in the border areas of the country,” said Bozumbayev.
      In this regard, in order to prevent a rise in fuel prices in Kazakhstan, as well as to reduce the risk of a shortage of diesel fuel, the Ministry of Energy is working on measures to temporarily ban the export of petroleum products (diesel fuel) outside the borders of Kazakhstan on the basis of current legislation that does not contradict the EAEU norms.
      The retail price of gasoline AI-92 in Kazakhstan is 154.8 tg / l, in the Russian Federation — 230.5 tg / l, in Uzbekistan — 273 tg / l, in Kyrgyzstan — 234 tg / l. The price of one liter of diesel fuel in Kazakhstan is 193.2 tenge, in the Russian Federation — 246.5 tg, Kyrgyzstan — 250.8 tg, in Uzbekistan — 208 tg.
      Gas production amounted to 50.5 billion m³, showing an increase of 4.8% compared with January-November 2017, or by 6.1% more than the plan for 11 months. Gas export amounted to 17.9 billion m³, which is more than the same period in 2017 by 14%.
      According to the Ministry of Energy of Kazakhstan, 2.8 million tons of liquefied petroleum gas was produced, which is 7.3% more compared to the same period of 2017. Production of petroleum bitumen was 809 thousand tons, which is 147% compared to the same period of 2017 and 108% of the plan for 2018.
      Electricity generation amounted to 96.7 billion kWh, which is 4.8% more compared to the same period in 2017.
      The volume of uranium mining amounted to 19.6 thousand tons (the plan for 11 months is 19.4 thousand tons, the plan for 2018 is 21.6 thousand tons), which is 93% compared to the corresponding period of 2017, and 100.8% to plan for 11 months.

      Chairperson of the Pharmacy Committee of the Ministry of Healthcare Lyudmila Byurabekova told about this during the online conference on the PrimeMinister.kz official site.

      As Byurabekova noted, the National Center for the Expertise of Medicinal Products within the framework of the Law “On Amendments and Additions to Certain Legislative Acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the Circulation of Medicinal Products and Medical Products” developed a mobile application, which is currently in test mode for approbation.
      In this mobile application, citizens will be able to see the registered layout of the package, the price of the drug, as well as whether the drug has passed a safety and quality assessment. In addition, users of the application will have the opportunity to leave feedback on the fact of price rises for certain medicines.
      “If suddenly a person sees that the price is higher than the one indicated in the mobile application, he will be able to take a picture and immediately send an appeal that the price is too high in the pharmacy. In addition, all prices will be posted on the Internet resources of the Ministry of Healthcare, the Pharmacy Committee, in the Center for Drug Evaluation. In the event of overpricing, citizens will be able to apply to our regional departments. Administrative responsibility is provided for this excess,” Byurabekova said.
      Byurabekova also spoke about the current situation on the drug market, taking into account the rapidly emerging digitalization. The new law provides for a full switch to e-procurement through a single distributor SK-Pharmacy LLP and other medical organizations.
      “To date, we have launched a procurem    of huge paper bags. Previously, it was several volumes, but now it is all tracked in electronic format,” said Byurabekova.
      In addition, the auction itself previously held in person with all participants. It took 3 to 5 days. The presence of all members of the tender commission and procurement participants was required. Now it all takes place online.
      The chairperson of the committee also said that new prescription rules are being developed in the implementation of this law, where doctors will only indicate the international non-proprietary name (each drug that has a trade name has an active substance, the so-called international non-proprietary name – INN). According to the new rules, the doctor will prescribe drugs in electronic format in the Unified system of drug supply. Then the patient goes to the pharmacy, where the pharmacist will offer him all products that they have in stock. The patient will be able to choose the best option she can afford.
      This law will also regulate seasonal price fluctuations.
      “We will set prices twice a year — in July and January. Prices will be valid throughout this period throughout the territory without hesitation. That is, below the marginal price that will be set, it will be possible to sell, above — administrative responsibility will already be provided for,” the chairperson of the Pharmacy Committee noted.
      In conclusion, Byurabekova gave the Kazakhstanis recommendations on the choice of drugs.
      “With regard to prescription drugs, I would like to address citizens, patients, if suddenly a situation arises that medication is necessary, this should be done only by a doctor’s prescription, with a prescription and only after receiving the drug in a pharmacy. If, however, the situation is such that just a cold virus infection, then you need to come to the pharmacy, consult a pharmacist who also has the appropriate education, and will help you find the right antipyretic drugs or symptomatic drugs. In general, I want to wish everyone to be healthy and not get sick!” Byurabekova summed up.

      It is worth noting that in MHSI system provides a gradual increase in outpatient care services. This will increase accessibility, reduce the order, therefore, will affect the quality of reception, because the doctor will be able to devote more time to each patient.

      At the online conference on the PrimeMinister.kz official site, Chairperson of the Pharmacy Committee of the Ministry of Healthcare Lyudmila Byurabekova told about innovations in the field of drug provision for the population. In particular, on the reduction of drug prices in the framework of the President’s Address.

      As Byurabekova noted, the law “On Amendments and Additions to Certain Legislative Acts on the Circulation of Medicinal Products and Medical Devices” was developed in accordance with the Address of the President to the People of Kazakhstan “Third Modernization of Kazakhstan: Global Competitiveness” and aims to regulate prices for all medicinal facilities.
      “As soon as the law comes into force — three months from the date of publication — the procedure will begin to determine wholesale and retail limit prices, above which medicines cannot be sold to wholesale distributors in the retail sector,” said Byurabekova.
      The goal of introducing state regulation of drug prices is to ensure uniform pricing mechanisms for medicines in the wholesale and retail segment, regardless of the region. This will increase the economic affordability of medicines for the population and increase the responsibility of participants in the pharmaceutical market: manufacturers of medicines, wholesale and retail sales organizations.
      The Chairperson of the Pharmacy Committee clarified that changes in the pricing of medicines imply 4 levels of price regulation — at the producer, wholesale, retail, and purchasing levels in the guaranteed volume of free medical care and the compulsory social health insurance system.
      “Four levels of price regulation relate directly to registration of the price by the manufacturer: they relate to those drugs that are registered in the Republic of Kazakhstan. Further, it will be approved taking into account the margin on the wholesale price and the maximum retail price. And separately, the rules will regulate pricing for the purchase of medicines in the framework of the guaranteed amount of free medical care and in the system of compulsory social health insurance,” Byurabekova noted.
      At the same time, prices for expensive medicines will also be regulated.
      Byurabekova emphasized that price regulation will not affect the quality of medicines.
      “Price and quality are two criteria that are always taken into account in drug supply. An expert organization, the National Center for the Evaluation of Medicines, is responsible for our quality. When registering, the company presents a whole package of documents confirming the quality of the drug. If the drug is registered in the territory of Kazakhstan, then it has confirmed its safety and quality. Accordingly, price regulation will not affect the quality of drugs. It will affect margins: that margin, that margin, which we will approve by order, we have actively discussed with the public and associations. And in principle, this extra charge suits them all. We do not expect that there will be a leaching or outflow of some drugs from the market,” said the chairperson of the pharmacy committee.
      However, in all regions of the country the prices of medicines will be the same.
      “Regardless of the region, whether the rural or urban pharmacy prices will be approved by the order and act equally within the entire territory of Kazakhstan,” said Byurabekova.

      Due to the wide coverage of immunization in the last 25 years the incidence of diphtheria has decreased by 30 times in Kazakhstan.

      "There was not any case of diphtheria in contrast  with 30 cases in 1991 (incidence rate per 100 thousand population was 0.18) among children under the age of 14 in 2015 - 8 cases (rate per 100 thousand population - 0.15)," the statement the Ministry of health and social development of the Republic of Kazakhstan reads.
      The diphtheria is hard flowing infectious disease that is transmitted by airborne droplets.
      The disease begins  from general malaise and fever, pain when swallowing. People mistaken the first symptoms for angina, which is very dangerous and can lead to serious consequences. Diphtheria is no other infection, gives a lot of complications, such as heart muscle paralysis, breathing muscles and diaphragm, soft palate, muscles of the face, neck, trunk and extremities. If this infection is high mortality, die each year from 10 to 20% of patients.
      The main method of preventing the disease is vaccination. Vaccination starts at 2 months and can be extended to 60 years, according to the National immunization calendar of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Refusal of vaccination may lead to the accumulation of susceptible people and cause disease outbreaks.

      In Kazakhstan, from 2004 to 2016 patients  of medial organizations received high-quality medical care through 133,392 telemedicine consultations.

      According to the ministry, only in 2015 patients received 24,970 telemedicine consultations in different nosology. The most required consultations were:  in cardiology - 5600 sessions, in pulmonology - 3215 sessions,  in neurology - 2251 session, and others.
      To date, the National Telemedicine Network (NTN) brings together 199 health facilities across the country and is divided into district, regional and national levels. Employees  of medical organizations of district level (141 district and city hospital) can get advice from their colleagues from regional hospitals and national medical centers.
      Timely and correct diagnosis and prescription of treatment via telemedicine allows physicians to solve issues of emergency medical aid to patients, reduce travel costs and the cost  of the delivery and  support for heavy patients in regional or republican clinic.
      The NTN is also used for conference calls and national headquarters on the activities of health care organizations in videoconference.
      Specialists from the medical universities, national research institutes and national centers conduct educational television lectures and seminars for medical staff of regional and district hospitals for specialized diseases.
      It should be recalled that Kazakhstan has been implementing  project  on creation and development of a national telemedicine network since 2004. It is intended to provide patients telemedicine consultation of qualified doctors, regardless of location and distance from regional and national medical centers. The NTN can eliminate the existing gap of secondary and tertiary medical care between urban and rural population of the republic.

      Quality of medical services is an essential component of the population’s well-being. In the Address of the President “Growing Welfare of Kazakh Citizens: Increase in Income and Quality of Life,” specific tasks for further development of health system are identified. Read the report by PrimeMinister.kz on the work done to achieve the target indicators in 2018 as well as on the progress in implementing the Head of State’s instructions.

      In 2016, Kazakhstan launched the Densaulyq State Program for the Development of the Health Care System, designed to ensure the gradual implementation of the OECD standards in the health sector. The main objective of the program is to increase the life expectancy of the population of Kazakhstan to 73 years by 2020.
      For one year of the implementation of the Program, the life expectancy of Kazakhstanis has increased by 0.8% compared with 2016 (72.4). Thus, life expectancy in 2017 was 72.95 years, which indicates a possible achievement of the indicator in 2019 to 73.13 years.
       
       
      In order to improve the efficiency of the domestic health care system further, a lot of legislative work has been done in 2018.
      Thus, to implement the Address “New Opportunities under the Fourth Industrial Revolution,” the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Amendments and Additions to Certain Legislative Acts on Health Issues” was adopted. This document is aimed at improving the corporate management system in medical organizations, developing the institution of donation and transplantation; improving the system of public health, medical education, increasing the quality of training and research, the system of compulsory social health insurance; ensuring the quality and effectiveness of medical care; implementing the National Health Accounts system, etc.
      In addition, the Law “On Amendments and Additions to Certain Legislative Acts on the Circulation of Medicinal Products and Medical Devices” was adopted. This will allow to create a patient-oriented drug supply model, taking into account modern requirements of Kazakhstan society. Along with this, legislative changes will make it possible to increase the efficiency of regulation in the sphere of circulation of drugs and medical devices, including the development of the principles of accessibility, quality, efficacy, and safety, which, in turn, are the basis for the rational use of medicines.
      For 2019, the Ministry of Healthcare envisages the development of a new version of the draft Code “On Public Health and the Healthcare System” and the accompanying draft law. It should be noted that the drafts of these documents have already been developed. Currently, the projects are under discussion in an interdepartmental working group, as well as with relevant experts and representatives of the business community.
       
       
      As part of the implementation of the Address of the Head of State dated October 5, 2018, a set of measures is taken to improve the quality and accessibility of primary health care.
      The Densaulyq State Program for 2016-2019 provides for a reduction in the burden on the district doctor. Following the results of 9 months of 2018, the average number of the assigned population per 1 general practitioner decreased by 8.3% and amounted to 1,901 people. To reduce the load further, it is planned to open 247 areas of general practitioners in addition. In order to increase the availability of medicine, projects of public-private partnership will also be developed to create compact forms of primary health care, as close as possible to the place of residence of the population.
      According to the ministry’s information, the modernization of the ambulance and emergency medical service has reduced the waiting time by 7 minutes. Thus, the required time for today is 18 minutes.
      In the framework of the Densaulyq program, in order to get feedback from the population, non-governmental organizations are expected to conduct sociological studies to assess public satisfaction with the quality of medical services.
      In 2018, more than 36 thousand people over 18 years old living in cities and rural settlements of Kazakhstan were surveyed. Respondents answered questions about the activities of organizations providing outpatient care and inpatient care. In addition, the survey was conducted through social networks. The results of the study showed the achievement of the indicators planned in the state program (47%). Thus, the indicator of satisfaction of the population with the quality of medical services provided in the country amounted to 47.84%.
      The survey results allow you to make adjustments to work plans and make operational decisions to develop the quality of medical services in the regions further.
       
       
      In Kazakhstan, on the basis of international experience, a Public Health Service has been created, the goal of which is to create accessible and effective mechanisms for disease prevention and health promotion. In order to strengthen the capacity of the service, the National Center of Public Health was created in 2018.
      The Public Health Management Plan for 2018–2021 has been approved. The activities are aimed at developing regulatory legal acts, intersectoral interaction, school medicine and creating the environment that strengthens the reproductive and mental health of children and young people, preventing non-communicable and infectious diseases, promoting a culture of healthy nutrition, and conducting research and training.
      A single health care system has been formed in the country. One of the most effective measures to protect the health of citizens has become a regular screening. For the purpose of early detection of diseases that are the main causes of death and disability, the National Screening Program is being implemented. In 2017, taking into account the recommendations of international experts, the age group of the population to be screened was expanded to 70 years, the multiplicity of screening examinations was increased, and the coverage of target groups by 2022 would rise from 70% to 90%.
      During 9 months of 2018, 9,481,767 screening surveys of target populations were carried out, 714,945 cases of diseases were detected, and 341,503 people were registered at dispensary registration. In particular, the amount of children examined — 3,998,813, revealed diseases for 454,797, taken to the dispensary registration — 140,927.
      It should be noted that as a result of early detection of malignant neoplasms, mortality from cancer is decreasing. In general, a comprehensive plan has been adopted within the framework of the comprehensive fight against cancer, and the establishment of a scientific cancer center has been ensured. At the same time, the main focus will be on providing highly effective early diagnosis and treatment of cancer based on international best practices.
      As part of an order from the Head of State for the construction of the National Scientific Oncology Center, a roadmap for the implementation of the project for 2018-2020 was approved, a permanent working group was established to develop proposals. For the current date, the design organization has been selected and the design and estimate documentation is being developed. Equipping the National Scientific Oncology Center with modern medical and diagnostic equipment is planned using public-private partnership mechanisms. The Memorandums of cooperation were concluded.
      Since 2015, in pilot mode, and since 2018, in all regions, a program for the prevention of suicides among minors has been implemented. The number of suicides among adolescents in Kazakhstan over the past 3 years has decreased by 30%.
      As part of the implementation of the state program, methodical recommendations of the Uniform Standards on the Diet of Schoolchildren were developed and issued, which contain a 4-week menu of meals for catering for three age groups of students (7-10 years, 11-14 years and 15-18 years) in educational institutions.
      According to the Ministry of Healthcare of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the advantages of the developed menus are the balance of the main food substances (proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins and mineral substances) and energy; variety, the content of a large number of vegetables, fruits, the inclusion of fish, dairy products, etc. The diet provides only healthy cooking methods (cooking, steaming, stewing).
      At the same time, in order to form common approaches in the provision of school medical services, the Ministry of Healthcare, in coordination with the Ministry of Education and industry research centers, developed guidelines for organizing school medical services.
      Considering the impact of advertising on the diet, the Ministry of Healthcare has changed the approaches to advocacy work with the population on the formation of a healthy lifestyle. Thus, in 2018, 29 national programs were developed and implemented, with an emphasis on 7 target groups, including children from 3 years old and persons older than 64 years.
      Over the past year, 503,557 events were held on the formation of a healthy lifestyle and prevention of behavioral risk factors (thematic classes, parent meetings, classroom and curator hours, large-scale events, conferences, round tables, events in primary health care organizations, training workshops, sports, etc. ) with a total coverage of 8,921,735 people.
      Comprehensive work is being done on the prevention of infectious diseases: preventive and anti-epidemic measures are carried out on an ongoing basis, monitoring, analysis and prediction of infectious morbidity are carried out, and, if necessary, visits to the regions are carried out to provide practical assistance. In 2018, 60 visits were made to 13 regions.
      During the implementation of sanitary and quarantine control at the state border of the Republic of Kazakhstan, sanitary and quarantine control measures (examination and survey) covered 2,568,514 people: 105 passengers were detected with fever, five of them with cholera, who were promptly isolated and received the necessary treatment and were under medical supervision. It should be particularly noted that timely anti-epidemic measures have been taken to prevent the spread of infection among the population.
      In general, immunization is one of the priorities of preventive health care. Thanks to vaccination, the country has achieved epidemiological success in vaccine-infectious diseases. About 5 million people are vaccinated against infectious diseases in Kazakhstan annually, including 1.3 million children. In order to provide children with vaccines of guaranteed quality, vaccines certified by the World Health Organization are purchased in Kazakhstan.
       
       
      On behalf of the Head of State, in May 2018, a new model of the Guaranteed Amount of Free Medical Care was developed and introduced with clear boundaries of state obligations, simultaneously with the introduction of Compulsory Social Health Insurance.
      In the framework of the guaranteed healthcare, the minimum required amount of medical care will be provided to all citizens, oralmans, foreigners and stateless persons permanently residing in the Republic of Kazakhstan. In particular, these are ambulance and air ambulance, primary health care, emergency inpatient and inpatient care, palliative care, as well as for socially significant, main chronic diseases, consultative and diagnostic aid, outpatient medication, planned inpatient and inpatient care, medical rehabilitation for tuberculosis.
      In the Ministry of Healthcare, it is noted that the introduction of a new model will increase the availability of medical care, by increasing the financial support of the health system through state funding and contributions to the Medical Insurance Fund, to reduce the population’s costs of medical services, as well as reduce load of the emergency specialists and medical services.
      According to the Social Health Insurance Fund NJSC, the total amount of deductions and contributions of employers and individual entrepreneurs for compulsory social health insurance of 6.5 million people received in the period from July 1, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2018, amounted to 133 billion tenge.
      In addition, in accordance with the current legislation, since Jan. 1, 2018, the Foundation is also the operator of the guaranteed volume of medical care. Thus, the Fund has paid for services in the package of the guaranteed healthcare since the early 2018, and within the framework of the health insurance, it will start in 2020.
      In order to increase competition in the market of medical services, work has been carried out to deregulate the sphere. As part of the improvement of the regulatory framework, an audit of 66 sanitary rules was carried out, 29 obsolete rules were canceled. To date, there has been an increase in the number of private medical organizations participating in the guaranteed healthcare from 40% (2017) to 46% (2018).
       
       
      In accordance with the President’s Address “Third Modernization of Kazakhstan: Global Competitiveness” and the creation of a common market for medicines and medical devices in the Eurasian Economic Union, in January 2019, the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Amendments and Additions to Certain Legislative Acts on the Treatment of Medicines and medical products" was adopted. In addition, within the framework of the law, a number of related regulatory and legal acts have been developed.
      The goal of introducing state regulation of drug prices is to ensure uniform pricing mechanisms for medicines in the wholesale and retail segment, regardless of the region. As well as increasing the economic affordability of medicines for the population and securing the responsibility of participants in the pharmaceutical market: manufacturers of medicines, wholesale and retail sales organizations.
      Planned changes in the formation of prices for medicines imply four levels of price regulation — at the level of the manufacturer, wholesale, retail sales, as well as purchases under the guaranteed healthcare and the compulsory insurance system.
      According to the ministry, the regulation of prices for all medicines will ensure equal economic accessibility of citizens for the use of medicines.
      In addition, new pricing rules provide for the strengthening of economic expertise of the validity of prices for drugs and medical devices, including in the guaranteed healthcare and compulsory insurance system, by reviewing reimbursement prices and evaluating pharmacoeconomic data, as well as creating a register of drugs prices. This will increase the availability of pricing information to all interested parties. The entire application process will be carried out in electronic format on the website of the National Center for Drug Evaluation, currently an information system has been developed and launched in test mode.
       
       
      In the framework of the Densaulyq state program, work is underway to develop a unified infrastructure of the healthcare system based on the strategic goals of the industry, standards of design, construction, equipping of healthcare facilities and ensuring the quality of medical services.
      The health infrastructure is shaped according to the needs of the population on the basis of a single long-term plan for the development of a health network, which involves attracting investment and increasing the share of the private sector.
      It should be noted that, according to the current legislation, the construction and development of a network of healthcare organizations, and material and technical support are within the competence of local executive bodies. Regional long-term plans for the development of health infrastructure for 2018–2025 were approved by level of medical care, taking into account the specifics of the localities and the population’s need for specific types of medical care. Regional plans are brought to a single structure, reflect information on the existing network of health organizations, the planned restructuring and the need for health facilities.
      In the republic as a whole, the percentage of equipment of state healthcare organizations with medical equipment in accordance with the minimum standards increased by 4.5%, from 63.2% in 2017 to 67.7% in 2018.
      Separate work is carried out on the development of PPP projects. Thus, in the period 2016-2018, 241 leasing projects worth 4.9 billion tenge were implemented. In addition, transfers of a general nature for health care organizations allocated for material and technical equipment and major repairs, providing a guaranteed amount of free medical care in 2016-2018, amounted to more than 111.7 billion tenge.
      As part of the PPP for the purchase of medical equipment in the period 2017-2018, 16 contracts worth 5.4 billion tenge were concluded (computed tomography – 6, magnetic resonance imaging – 5, x-ray system – 1, equipment for the anesthesiology, resuscitation and intensive care departments – 1).
      There are 21 PPP projects in the total amount of 18 billion tenge (centers of positron emission, computer, magnetic resonance imaging; X-ray equipment).
      Together with global manufacturers of medical equipment such as Varian Medical Systems, Pharmstandard, Phillips, etc., memorandums of cooperation were concluded on equipping healthcare organizations based on the principles of PPP, as part of the Comprehensive Plan for the fight against cancer in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2018-2022, as well as in other priority areas.
      Also, the Ministry of Health is working to determine the need for medical equipment until 2021 and conduct an audit of previously purchased equipment. Draft amendments to the standards for equipping medical institutions of health care organizations, in terms of revising the standards for equipping multi-purpose hospitals, primary health care and emergency rooms in accordance with international standards, have been developed.
      In the regions of the country, according to the information of the local executive bodies of the regions, the cities of Astana, Almaty and Shymkent, contracts were concluded for 101 PPP projects for a total amount of 33.1 billion tenge.
      In general, according to the Statistics Committee of the Ministry of National Economy, in January-November 2018, 92.6 billion tenge of investments were attracted to the health care sector, including 38.9 billion extrabudgetary. The index of the physical volume of investments in fixed assets by the corresponding period of 2017 amounted to 118.7%.
       
       
      According to the Ministry of Healthcare, in 2018, the overall availability of doctors and paramedical personnel per 10,000 people is satisfactory.
      An extensive work was carried out in order to ensure the need for medical personnel. So, admission to medical universities has increased. Since 2016, compulsory three-year refining by graduates of residency has been introduced, and since 2019 — graduates from the internship program at medical universities study at the expense of the state educational order. In addition, akimats are given the opportunity to place an educational order at the expense of the local budget for training personnel with higher and postgraduate education for the region. Also universities are responsible for providing social support measures to young professionals.
      The measures taken to ensure staffing made it possible to reduce the shortage of medical personnel from 3.8 thousand specialists in 2014 to 2.8 thousand specialists in 2017, i.e., by 34.6%. In 2019, taking into account the employed graduates, the shortage of medical personnel is planned to be reduced to 1,600 posts.
       
       
      The work continues on the introduction of advanced methods of providing medical services. For example, the National Science Center for Oncology and Transplantology uses hybrid technologies in the treatment of vascular pathology, combining the advantages of open classical and minimally invasive endovascular surgery (based on the insertion of catheters and other instruments through a small puncture of the skin – without a cut). These methods give a therapeutic effect comparable to traditional surgery with less pain and without complications. Endovascular techniques are used in the field of vascular surgery, prevention of ischemic strokes, treatment of chronic venous insufficiency, Angiosurgical care for cancer patients.
      At the Research Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedics, high-tech operations are carried out, including arthroscopic interventions on the knee and shoulder joints (minimally invasive surgical manipulation performed for the purpose of diagnosing and / or intra-articular injuries) are performed on an ongoing basis. Cellular technologies are being actively developed and introduced in the correction of the pathology of cartilage tissue (growing cells on the basis of the patient’s tissue). Together with the National Center for Biotechnology, stem cell cultivation has been developed, the stage of preclinical studies has been completed, and clinical trials are currently being implemented.
      Thanks to the introduction of the Unified National Health System, the possibilities of providing high-tech medical services to the population have expanded. By technology profile "Traumatology and Orthopedics" for 2012-2017, the number of services rendered increased from 12,023 to 20,168, including: knee joint arthroplasty — by 5.6 times; hip joint — 1.7 times; arthroscopic operations — 1.8 times.
      In the first 11 months of 2018, more than 3,000 operations were performed in the framework of the provision of high-tech medical services at the Research Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedics. Thus, the number of complete and partial replacements of the knee and hip joints in 2018 amounted to 1,329 cases treated, revision endoprosthesis of the knee and hip joints — 110, spinal surgery using the navigation system — 99, vertebroplasty — 113, thoracoplasty — 46, spondylodesis using endocorrector — 169, complete replacement of the shoulder joint — 1.
      High-tech medical services in the framework of the guaranteed healthcare are provided to citizens of Kazakhstan on a free basis. At that, the cost of one operation itself varies from 170 thousand tenge to 1.7 million tenge.
      Since the opening of JSC National Scientific Cardiac Surgery Center, 21 new technologies have been introduced to diagnose and treat circulatory system diseases, and more than 3,400 operations have been performed. On the basis of the center, for the first time in Kazakhstan, a unique high-tech cardiac surgery was introduced for the treatment of patients with severe chronic heart failure: the implantation of a device for long-term mechanical support for blood circulation — an artificial left ventricle of the heart. Only 20 highly developed countries of the world (USA, Japan, Canada, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, etc.) are conducting this operation today. To date, in the center from 2012 to 11 months of 2018, 274 devices have been implanted, 70 heart transplants have been performed. Also, from December 2015 to 2017, 8 lung transplants were performed.
      In addition, an innovative technology was introduced - an invasive extracorporeal oxygen saturation method (oxygenation) in patients with severe respiratory, cardiac or cardiorespiratory failure. Already, 271 operations have been performed.
       
       
      According to the Ministry of Healthcare, within the framework of the Digital Kazakhstan State Program, the Office of Health Digitalization has been established in the Ministry of Healthcare.
      Currently, within the framework of the State Program there are four projects:
      1) Introduction of elements of mobile health care (mHealth), including “remote consultations”;
      2) Creation and implementation of artificial intelligence in terms of establishing the diagnosis and management of treatment plans;
      3) Introduction of medical information systems;
      4) Implementation of the Information Platform and Interoperability of the information systems in the Ministry of Health.
      The Ministry is working to launch the integration Platform together with the Ericsson Nikola Tesla d.d.
      One of the fundamental principles of digitalization of health care is patient-centeredness, the implementation of which requires the introduction of an electronic health passport. Patient information will be stored in the Unified e-health passport repository that is part of the Platform and will be available to both medical professionals and patients. The electronic health passport includes data on the results of the examination and treatment of the patient in the medical organizations of the country, including previously suffered and chronic diseases, possible allergic reactions to medicines, recommendations on nutrition, diet and more.
      User access to the information stored in the Platform will be organized through the patient’s personal account and the health worker’s office.
      The Republican e-health center is working on the integration of 19 information systems of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Platform.
      As part of the introduction of elements of mobile health, mobile applications have been developed for visiting nurses and parents to care for children. Test versions are available for downloading on the Google Play Market.
      At the same time, Kazakhstan IT service providers launched about 20 mobile applications. At the regional level, there are mobile applications “DamuMed” and "To the Doctor." The number of downloads of mobile applications Dec. 1, 2018, is 1,562,754.
      On the basis of the Kazakh Research Institute of Oncology and Radiology, together with IBM, pilot testing was carried out on the project of artificial intelligence in health care — Watson for Oncology. In the period from July 16 to Aug. 8, 2018, the analysis of existing business and clinical processes, data processing, the provision of a technical review; selection of treated cases and nosologies for approbation work was carried out. Currently, work is underway on the financing model under the PPP.
      It should be noted that since January 2018, a phased process of digitization of the health care system of the Republic of Kazakhstan has been launched in terms of the transition to paperless medical records.

      The Prime Minister of Kazakhstan discussed urgent issues at a meeting with doctors and representatives of the social sphere in Almaty.

      The meeting with the medical community and NGOs was held at the Scientific Center of Pediatrics and Pediatric Surgery. Kazakhstan is home to 75.7 thousand children with disabilities under the age of 18 years.
      The protection of the rights and interests of the children is one of the main directions of the state policy. Particular attention is paid to creating conditions for children with limited development. Karim Massimov noted that state agencies and non-governmental organizations must work closely together on this issue.
      According to Vice Minister of Health and Social Development of the RK S. Zhakupova children  have disabilities  such as congenital malformations, nervous system diseases, mental disorders, including autism. The number of children with autism in the country is 1095 people.
      S. Zhakupova noted that to address these issues, Kazakhstan modernized the system of early detection of mental and physical development in children.
      In particular, Z. Baliyeva noted that the social adaptation of children with special needs is a laborious process, requiring an integrated approach in conjunction with civil society organizations and government institutions.
      So,  Director of the private charity foundation "Asyl Miras" M. Aytmagametova noted that in Kazakhstan there is a network of resource centers that use modern methods of diagnosis of mental illness, but children with disabilities are poorly integrated into society.
      Director of the Corporate Fund "Bolashak" D. Chayzhunusova reported on problems of social, medical and educational support for children with disabilities.
      Vice-Minister of Education and Science of Kazakhstan E. Sukhanberdiyeva spoke about the work carried out by the Ministry to tackle autistic children.
      Summing up the meeting, the Prime Minister instructed the Health and Social Development Ministry, Education and Science to approve the roadmap of health care and education and upbringing of children with the disorder, such as autism,  by 15 October this year.

      Today, citizens pay more than a third of the costs of medical services at their own expense. Compulsory social health insurance (CSHI) should significantly reduce these costs. Еhe head of the department Yelzhan Birtanov gave an overview on how the Ministry of Health intends to solve this problem at a press conference following the results of the meeting of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

      According to him, basically citizens spend their own money for two basic categories - medical products and consultative and diagnostic services.
      "For medicines - in addition to price regulation within the framework of medical insurance, we plan to gradually increase the coverage of population with free medicines as the money accumulates in the Fund,"  Minister said.
      For consultative and diagnostic services - mainly to the services of private diagnostic centers, Kazakhstanis resorted to cases when the quality of advisory services in public clinics is not satisfying, and more often because of large queues to specialists providing services free of charge.
      "We are reviewing the rules in this direction. First of all, the rules are aimed at reducing regulatory barriers - we must reduce queues and allow private suppliers to provide these services free of charge due to medical insurance," Y. Birtanov said.
      These rules will be developed already this year. According to Minister, with the introduction of the CSHI, by doctor's prescription a citizen can go to any consultant of his choice.

      According to the vice minister, the country is optimizing healthcare facilities from 640 to 347 by creating multi-disciplinary clusters, which will increase the availability of a wide range of medical servies.
      “We conducted an analysis where about 4.6 thousand beds remained free, unfilled and were in standby mode. We can reclassify these beds for more needed directions,” said Tsoy.
      As noted by the vice minister, with the enlargement of polyclinics, they will remain geographically in the same place, the medical staff will continue to work in the same composition. Optimization will only affect administrative staff. The country is undergoing large-scale digitalization, which allows you to solve many issues remotely.
      The Ministry of Healthcare is carrying out comprehensive work to increase the availability of medical care in the countryside.
      “We focus on bringing qualified specialists, medical assistance directly to the village, closer to our citizens so that they do not go to the district centers and they have the opportunity to undergo screening tests, preventive examinations from narrow specialists”, said the vice minister
      With this purpose, in addition to the existing 122 primary medical complexes, they are purchased in accordance with the need of 18 such points.
      In addition, health trains are launched, which are also equipped with all necessary medical equipment. In 2019 it is planned to increase the coverage of the population from remote settlements almost twice. In order to bring medical care to rural residents in the normal mode, the work of air ambulance is also being conducted.
      “We use helicopters of the Emergency Committee here. Aircraft on the market there. We have a single helicopter service operator,” said Tsoy.
      In addition, the vice minister informed that, as part of the modernization of the material and technical equipment of health facilities, it is necessary to additionally attract about 1.3 trillion tenge. The share of private investment in the health care system is planned to increase from 40 to 60%.
      “We are implementing 17 regional long-term plans, that is, we have identified the need of medical organizations in the regions and each region sets its own plans until 2025,” said Tsoy.

      To date, 9 health facilities in different regions have been transferred to trust management. The Asian Development Bank accompanies the implementation of 4 PPP projects in Kazakhstan medicine, said Minister of Health Yelzhan Birtanov during the press conference following the results of the meeting of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

      "It is very important to attract private investment in the health system. Since health care is a branch that constantly requires investment," Y. Birtanov said.
      Thus, in spite of the active construction of health facilities and the yearly increase in budget revenues to the industry, the infrastructure deficit in the health sector of the Republic of Kazakhstan remains high. More than 60% of health organizations are located in premises with a service life of more than 30 years from the time of commissioning, about half of them are housed in non-typical buildings, many health organizations are not provided with the necessary equipment. This, according to the minister, leads to irrational use of funds for the exploitation of outdated buildings, hospital management costs, low rates of introduction of modern technologies, which ultimately affects the quality of services provided.
      The need to develop infrastructure and attract modern technology in the medical industry will require significant budgetary costs. In this situation, PPP will be the main tool for attracting the necessary financial resources.
      The Ministry of Health together with mayor's offices compiled a list of facilities offered to private investors for construction, privatization and trust management. There are two directions for investors. As part of the first, a private investor builds health facilities at his own expense, reimburses his costs on the basis of a long-term contract and receives income associated with activities during the life of the facility. Within the framework of the second direction, the Ministry of Health proposes to take over the existing, but low-efficiency state facilities, in order to reduce the investment load, based on the quality criteria of the activities of these organizations. Local executive bodies are actively working in both directions. 9 objects in different regions have already been transferred to management.
      "We believe that the private sector has the opportunity to invest in capital repairs, re-equipment, purchase of sanitary transport and a higher motivation for work because today's funding is based on the final result. In the future, the compulsory social health insurance system will also be clearly evaluated based on the final result," Minister said.
      An agreement with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on the preparation of 4 pilot PPP projects in the field of out-patient care was signed. ADB has already allocated over 200 thousand dollars to prepare pilot projects in 2016. The bank is ready to allocate more than 500 thousand dollars for this sphere in 2017.

      T. Duisenova stressed that the government retains the entire amount of funding to provide free medical care, which includes an ambulance and emergency care, provision of medical care in socially significant diseases and vaccination for 17 million Kazakhstanis.

Duisenova explained that every healthcare organization will be able to regulate the labor of their employees payment system depending on their qualifications, workload and quality of services.
      According to the minister, this mechanism has been practiced in private healthcare organizations that allow to adequately assess the work of good experts.

      The minister also stressed that patients’ informal payments will lose relevance in MSHI system, as the whole package of services will be guaranteed to the insured persons as part of health insurance.
