## Abstract

In this paper authors present new linguistic resource - open Kazakh-English parallel corpus.
We describe a technology that was used to create that resource, problems we met during our work and results that we received.

## Introduction

Corpora is a basis for many linguistic research.
Since Kazakh is still considered to be a low resourced language, creation of new corpora is a very important task for the language.
The main idea of this paper is to describe a technology (a software) that allows to collect, clean, and align large amounts of texts from official multilingual web sites with as minimum manual work as possible.
our Goal was to produce such tecnology and apply it for creation of open Kazakh-English parallel corpus.
In the cource of our work we encountered a number of problems and questions:

* which sources to use for collecting presumably parallel texts;
* how to improve quality of the texts;
* how to minimize efforts for text alignment;
* how to maximize the number of aligned sentences in the result.
Logically, theese problems and questions

A set of tools that help for creation of parallel Kazakh-English corpora

The main idea of this paper is: we want to propose a way to collect ... (ощутимые) amount of parallel Kazakh-English corpora with very good quality in both texts and alignment and as (мало) manual operations as possible

Describe the problem

Kazakh is under resourced language.
The situation with linguistic recources gets better with every year.
But it seems like it does not improve quickly enough.
There are quite some projects aimed at creation of recorces (list)...

Parallel corpora with Kazakh are not many.
(list, enu, wmt, ?)
Our previous attempt at creation of parallel Kazakh-English corpora [...] revieled following (трудности)
- low quality of texts
- mix of languages
- alignment problems
- manual validation

State your contributions

We created a set of tools that help to deal with described  (трудности).

The set is available at (github)
Using the set we were able to produced (number) parallel Kazakh-English sentences.
